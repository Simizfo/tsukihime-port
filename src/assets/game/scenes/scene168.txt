` I glance at the clock.@
` It's already past nine.@
` I'm late as it is, but it's not too late yet.\

`"No, I'd better not.@ I'll help you, but I can't let that affect my daily life.@ I've already decided we'll only work at night."@

`"…… Oh?"@
` Looking like she wants to complain, she stares at me.\

`"Well, you have a point.@ You're helping me to protect your way of living, so it wouldn't make any sense to go out of your normal life to do so."@
` She takes in my point rather easily.@
` …… She's emotional yet logical, I guess that would be like her.\

`"You can enjoy your life all you want.@ As long as you don't forget your promise, there's no problem."@

` Saying that, she walks over to the window.@

` Arcueid tells the truth jokingly as she disappears.@
` Jumping out the window, she bounds from tree branch to tree branch.\

`"………… She was pretty angry."@
` But, school is important for me too.@
` I spend the nights with her, so I think it's alright if I relax during the day.\

`"Well then, shall I go to school?"@
` Because I slept all night, my body's completely recovered.@
` I have to quickly change into my uniform and sneak out so Hisui and Kohaku-san don't see me.\

`"Hm----"@
` I'm a little dizzy.@
` …… It's probably the after-effects of yesterday.@ My body feels a bit heavy and I have a slight headache.@
`"…… Well, I guess this much is okay."@
` Just a small amount of dizziness.@ I can always take it easy once I sit down at my desk in school.@
` I get myself together and jog towards school.\

` ----*sigh*@
` I manage to make it into class before third period.@
` Looking around, Arihiko's seat is empty.@ He's probably absent, but that means today will be quiet.\

` Lunch time.@
` It looks like Arihiko's not coming.@
` …… Inui Arihiko and Yumizuka Satsuki are the two people absent today.@ Yumizuka Satsuki has caught a cold or something and she will be absent for a while.\

`"…… Senpai doesn't seem to be coming too, so I guess I'll eat by myself."@
` I say that, but I'm not hungry.\

` …… What is it?@
` I didn't feel so good to begin with, but after coming to school, I feel a lot worse.@
` It's not just my body feeling heavy.@ The scar on my chest is irritating; it's an annoying sensation.\

`"…… Maybe I shouldn't have come to school."@
` …… For a brief moment, I see the worrying faces of Hisui and Akiha in my mind.@
` Being worn out by just sitting, I start to feel a strange uneasiness.\
