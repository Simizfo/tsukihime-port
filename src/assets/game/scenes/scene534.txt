` Bonjour!@
` Now the hint corner for Tohno-kun who has met yet another Dead End,
` It is time for "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!"\

` The second period lesson of the third day will be about filial love.@
` The reason you died this time is simple, Tohno-kun.@ There wasn't enough incentive in you to pull Yumizuka-san off of you the instant she bit you.\

` Bonds of family are very important.@
` Classmates are also important.@
` You have to make sure you concern yourself with being a good Onii-chan, and you have to somehow answer your classmate's love.@ Yes, you have obligations to both of them.\

` So a little piece of advice.@
` Tohno-kun, it's probably good if you go back and show Yumizuka-san some sincerity.@
br
` Well then, let's meet again in the next lesson, everyone.\
