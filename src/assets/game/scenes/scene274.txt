` Eight years since I awoke.@
` I've been holding my breath in darkness the whole time.\

` I don't even know why.@
` That has long since been worn away.@
` Here, there is only darkness.@
` But, I know there is something I have to do.\

` I don't know why I live.@
` But I know my purpose.@
` The chains which held me are all gone.@
` There is nothing holding me back.@
