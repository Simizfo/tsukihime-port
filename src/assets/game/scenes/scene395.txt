` As usual, Arihiko is skipping school.@

`"…… I'll go eat at the cafeteria."@
` If I eat by myself, I'll just end up being depressed.@
` If I go eat in the cafeteria full of people, it should help me get my mind off of things.\

` As expected, the cafeteria is packed.@
` After waiting in a long line, I buy the tried and true meal set A and walk to a table.@
` The students' voices are pretty loud, so I am able to concentrate on just eating my meal.@
` I use my fork and eat in silence.@
br
` ----And then.@
br
` For a moment, I see a terrible image.\

`"……?@ Is it the television screen?"@
` I gape at the large television mounted on the wall at the end of the cafeteria.@
` At my school, they record the morning news and replay it at lunch.@
` I just stare dumbfounded at the news broadcast that is several hours late.\

`"----No way…"@
` I watch the news in amazed horror.@
` Shown in the television is the alley that I saw last night in my dream.@
` The newscaster is talking.@
` On the screen, the words "Vampire Serial Killer's Ninth Victim" appears in bloody lettering.\

` The woman with the long hair, she was definitely the one I killed in my dream.\

`"How…… come?"@
` That was a dream.@ It had to be a dream.@
` But in reality, the same person as in my dream, in the same place as my dream, is killed in the same way as my dream.\
`"The vampire should be gone already."@
` I killed Yumizuka with my own hands.@
` Those killings, they shouldn't be happening anymore.\

`"I---killed?"@
` Yes, I killed.@
` Just like the time I killed Yumizuka.@
` While breathing hard, last night, that woman I've never met---\
