` Well, I just have to deceive her somehow.@
` I don't think Akiha will understand about non-humans like Arcueid and Nrvnqsr, so I'll have to minimize my lying without telling the truth.@
br
`"--Alright, let's go."@
` Taking a deep breath, I open the sitting room door.\

` In the sitting room, Akiha is on the sofa and Hisui is standing by the wall.@

`"--Good morning, Nii-san."@
` Her gaze is telling me "I am angry."@
`"Um, uh…… Morning, Akiha."@
`"Let's dispense with greetings.@ Please sit there.@ I wish to speak with you, Nii-san."@
`"------"@
` Her words are so forceful, I can't say no.@
` I solemnly and calmly sit down on the sofa across from Akiha.\

`"Nii-san.@ This is very abrupt, but may I ask about these past two days?"@
`"----Ugh."@
` Despite her polite language, Akiha's words are unmistakably a threat.@
` But, her Onii-chan cannot tell her such a story.\

`"About that, Akiha."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, what is it?"@
`"The truth is, I ran into a minor acquaintance of mine and I showed that person around the city."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh?@ A minor acquaintance?"@
`"Yeah, I got to know the person just recently, and we met just outside of school.@ I was asked to keep this acquaintance company until Sunday, so--"\

`"So you skipped school and stayed away from home without even notifying me or asking permission."@
br
` …… Akiha's gaze is extremely frigid.@
` She seems even more shocked than angry.\

`"…………………"@
`"…………………"@
` I remain quiet as Akiha stares at me wordlessly.@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"And, who was it?"@
`"Eh?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I asked who this acquaintance of yours is."@
` She looks at me directly in the eye.@
` I can feel her thinking "I will not be deceived".\

`"--Well, I--"@
`"If you can't tell me, that means you feel guilty about it, Nii-san."@
` Her gaze shoots right through me.@
` I get the feeling she'll attack me more if I look away, so I stare back at her.\

` …… Well, this is totally random, but…
` She does not remind me of the Akiha from back then.@
` Her stretched back, her perfect posture, her unwavering eyes.@
` Perhaps this is imprudent, but I honestly think she has become very beautiful.\

`"You know, Akiha."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What?"@
`"Your eyebrows are pretty thick."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t15a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"------!?"@
` Bam!@ Akiha's leg smacks the table as she jumps up.@
`"………… Ah."@
` How do I say this--she's surprisingly surprised?@
`"…… I don't get you at all.@ That wasn't something to be surprised about."@
`"---------"@
` With a deep breath, Akiha slumps her shoulders.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san, it seems like you do not wish to answer me seriously."@
`"…… That's not right.@ Honestly, I won't lie to you.@ It's just that I have a lot of things I can't say to you."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Geez.@ Really, ever since we were small I was never able to tell if you were an honest or dishonest person, Nii-san."\

`"…… Really?@ I don't really remember how I was when I was small."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t13a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"You don't have to remember.@ But, I haven't changed either.@ Pressing you like this even when I know how it will turn out… maybe I haven't grown up at all."\
