` Senpai suddenly enters into my classroom.@
` She strides directly to me.\

` And she suddenly yells at me.@
`"Wh, what is it, Senpai?@ I haven't done anything bad to make you angry."@
`"No excuses.@ Just come over here, please."\

` Under Senpai's intensity, I quickly snap to attention.@ And like yesterday, Senpai starts to sniff me.@
`"…… Um, Senpai……?"\
