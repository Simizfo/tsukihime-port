` It's now past two, so to ease my hunger I take us to a fast food restaurant.@
br
` …… I don't even know if she eats this kind of food, but after Arcueid stares long and hard at the menu, she ends up ordering the same thing I did.\

`"…………"@
` I sit down across from her.@
` After Arcueid looks around quickly, she pops a french fry in her mouth like she's done it before many times.\

`"…… Wow, you seem pretty used to it.@ I thought maybe it was your first time."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah, this is the first time I've done it.@ I've known about places like these, but it was only from information sources."@
`"Just information…… I see, you watch the news so I guess you read magazines too."\

`"Hm, not quite like that, I need knowledge to fit in with the times, right?@ So when I wake up, I study the information of that time and then go into action.@
` Well, it's usually over in a few days so it usually ends up being useless."@
`"……?"@
` She says things that are hard to understand like this from time to time.@
`"Hmm…… why does it end up useless?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Because I go to sleep right away.@ I don't know how many years later I wake up the next time, so I can't use much of what I remember.@ After it is over, all I do is sleep.@
` …… Hm, but maybe I've been missing out.@
` I only knew the world through those sources.@ I knew about how people would gather like this, but I never experienced it."\

`"I see…… But isn't knowing just enough?@ Just now, you ordered some food like it was perfectly natural."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Of course.@ I studied, so I can act that way.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` But, that's all.@ Experience is far greater than theory.@ Even if I know about zillions of things, it's useless if I've never done them."@
` Arcueid sighs.\

`"Is that so…… I think some people say theory makes up for a lack of experience."@
`"That's something those who only know theories say.@ …… I used to think that way until just recently."@
` Arcueid's expression starts to cloud.@
` For some unknown reason, I don't like seeing her face like that.\

`"Is that so?@ I think there's just those for whom theory can make up for lack of experience and those for whom experience trumps theory.@ There's a lot of people out there in the world, so not everyone is the same."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Wow, you got really deep and serious, Shiki."@
`"Hey now, Arcueid-san.@ You're the one who started being all serious, I was just going along.@ Don't kill the conversation like that."@
br
` Um, since you're telling me all that stuff about yourself.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah, I know.@ You always listen to me when I want to talk.@ You always yell at me, but you listen to me when it's serious."@
` "Ahaha," Arcueid laughs brightly.@
` …… Hmph.@
` That's what she thinks, anyway.@
` But, I think such a genuine smile suits her best.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I was thinking about what you said earlier.@ I really am narrow-minded.@ I can't really see anything else after I make up my mind.@
` Not needing anyone but myself.@
` I'm the only one who is right.@ I can only think in those terms.@
` ----That's right.@ There are a lot of hearts out there, so there's a lot of people that can do easily what I can't."@
` She somehow seems very gentle as she contemplates.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, but, even if I contemplate it, my personality won't change.@
` I like this me the best, and I believe it is the correct way."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


` She smiles as she says those courageous words.@ Then she looks around like before and takes a bite of her hamburger.\
br
` Chomp.@ Chomp.@
br
` As if to erase any image of her being a vampire, Arcueid chows down on her junk food.@
`"…………"@
` How come?@
` It seems impossible to look elegant while eating a hamburger, but Arcueid makes it look beautiful.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"What……?@ Staring at me like that.@ Ah, is this not how you eat it……!?"@
` Arcueid hurriedly puts her hamburger back on her tray.@
` She then wipes her mouth with a paper napkin.@ But even that simple action seems so elegant.\

`"…… No, it's right.@ It's right, but it's strange.@ In your case, it doesn't suit you, so don't do it."@
` I don't even know why I say that as I chomp on my hamburger like a hamburger should be eaten.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What do you mean it doesn't suit me?"\

`"It's an image problem.@ That small mouth of yours isn't fit to eat fast food.@ Fries aren't a problem, so you can have my share."@
` I put my french fries on her tray.@
br
` …… I really don't know what I'm doing at all.\

`"I don't want them.@ I don't feel like eating just those."@
` After saying that, she brings the hamburger to her mouth once more.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

\
` …… She might be worried about my stare, as she eats it more normally.@ Well, I can live with that.@
` …… But a hamburger-eating vampire?@
` All living things need nutrition to live, so they eat.@
` Before, Arcueid declared she doesn't drink blood.@
` So, in order to gain that nutrition, does she eat food just like us normal humans……?\

`"…… Hey, Arcueid."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"What, you meanie?"@
`"No, I wasn't going to criticize you.@ I just had a question, if that's okay."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Sure----what is it?"@
`"Um, you're a vampire, right?@ Then I was wondering maybe if food for you… was only blood."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t13.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` Her eyes widen.@
` …… I knew it.@ It was a rude question.@
` See, even Arcueid's facial expression is getting angry…… or not.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey Shiki, normally, I don't eat food.@
` Certainly eating like this allows me to move on my own, but it's more of a mental thing.@
` For me to eat, in other words,taking in nutrition, is a different process than the one you have.@
` I do have an appetite, but maybe it's more akin to lust.@
` If I don't eat, I get irritated, but since I don't put much priority on it, inversion impulses rarely happen."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
\
` She easily denies the blood as food theory.@
` Yeah, that's what it is.@
` She really seems to be okay with not drinking blood.\

`"I see----"@
` That's good.@ Arcueid isn't someone that kills humans to feed.@ It really is a good thing.@
` …… Geez.@ If Arcueid just said from the beginning "I'm a vampire that doesn't suck human blood", then I would have agreed to help her from the…… start……
br
`"…… Hey, wait a minute!@ You don't call that a vampire!"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"You do.@ Even you can't resist eating for one day, right?@
` For those vampires who are True Ancestors--like me, the highest class of food, the thing that can satisfy our desires the most is blood.@
` So in order to "live" and "fulfill our desires", we can substitute blood with other things."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"But when it comes to the Dead Apostles--vampires that were originally human, it is a different matter.@ In order to maintain their existence, they need the blood of others."\

`"……?@ Um, in other words the best way to satisfy your hunger is blood?@
` …… But you said you hated drinking blood.@
` So just like people who don't like certain food, you hate the taste of blood?"@
` I take a guess at a satisfactory simplification for the long explanation she gave.@
br
` However.@
` It seems like I was a little off.\

`"----Huh?"@

`"I told you I'm not a full vampire.@ Not knowing the taste of blood.@ I still don't know that.@
` All I know----is to drink human blood is to refuse to recognize them as people."@
` She looks away, not even trying to look at me.\

`"Hey Shiki.@ What if?@ What if birds or fish had the same amount of intelligence and life span as you did?@ Could you eat them?@ Could you justify it to yourself by saying no matter how much intelligence they have, they are still food?@ And then eat them?"@

`"------No, that's…"@
` Could I----eat them?@
` I don't know.@ I don't know, but first off, I'd try and eat other food, things that didn't have intelligence.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"See?@ Just like that.@ That's why I hate the thought of drinking blood.@ …… Well, maybe there are likes and dislikes as you said too.@
` If I could, I like to avoid the sight of blood.@
` But----Yes, but if… if humans didn't have the same worth, intelligence, or values than I did, then maybe I would drink blood.@
` Isn't providence of nature taking the lives of other things to protect your own?"@
` Right?@ Arcueid asks me for agreement.@
` But that--even if Arcueid says it, I can only deny it.@
` …… I don't want to agree to that.\

`"Certainly that may be true, but in the first place, humans are like you.@ …… So let's just cut short this kind of conversation.@ I don't like talking about 'what ifs'."@

`"What's wrong, Shiki?@ Your face got dark all of a sudden.@ Ah, do you have to go to the bathroom?"@
`"…… Hey.@ You come up with that when someone is thinking seriously?"@
` I sigh.@
` Even though I'm seriously thinking about it, Arcueid doesn't seem to think much about drinking blood.\

`"Yeah----it doesn't concern me."@

`"Geez, just mumbling to yourself like that.@ Trying to hide something isn't manly, Shiki!"@
` Arcueid looks like an angry cat again.\

`"Having fun--I'm not trying to do that."@
` I don't know where her bad mood went, but she suddenly calms down.@
` She looks like she's uneasy with me nailing it on the head.\

`"…… Really?@ You really were having fun seeing me stumped like earlier?@ Do you like teasing, or is it secrecy?@
` Well, we are two different kinds of life forms, so I don't care."@
`"Th, that's not it……!@ I was just trying to answer you.@ It probably looks like I'm hiding a lot of things because you never ask……"@
