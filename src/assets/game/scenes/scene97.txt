` ----I refuse.@
` I can't stand up to that monster.@
` She told me to be her shield and watch over her while she sleeps, but I couldn't even do that well.@
` Even if I were to fight with her, I would probably just get in the way.\

`"Arcueid.@ Sorry, but I can't.@ He's too different.@ Even if I fought him, I wouldn't even be able to scratch him."@

`"What?@ Really…?"@
` …… I'm not sure where she gets that from, but she tilts her head as if doubting me.\

`"…… I'm glad you think so highly of me, but I can't do it.@ Our promise was just for me to watch over you for one night.@ I don't want to have anything more to do with that monster."@

`"Hmm, it may be too late.@ Nrvnqsr met you.@ Even if you were no longer with me, I don't think he would leave you alone."@
` She speaks lightly as if discussing some third party.\

`"Wha------"@
` I blurt out, and then I understand.@
` That vampire Nrvnqsr is the one killing people in this town.@ There's no reason for him to leave me alone once I saw his face.\

`"But I am faster than Nrvnqsr.@ He cannot move during the day, and you're right in front of me, so it's overwhelmingly in my favor."@
`"…… What do you mean?"@

`"Oh, nothing.@ I was just thinking if you are going to run away, I would just kill you here."@
` Arcueid smiles as she jokes around, but she also seems serious.\

`"U…………, gh."@
` Her smile doesn't fade.@
` …… She really seems intent on coercing me.@

`"………… You devil."@
` …… I'm trapped.@
` If I'm going to be attacked either way, then there's no other choice but to help Arcueid.@
` I look up at the ceiling and take a deep breath.@
` Fortunately, that prepares me just a bit for what is to come.\

`"Okay, I'm ready.@ …… Come to think of it, there was no running away from the time I met you.@ Coming this far, I guess I have no choice but go all the way."\
