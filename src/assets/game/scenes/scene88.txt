`"Yeah, that's pretty much all true.@
` They drain the blood of virgins because one's blood cells are more pure before one has exchanged bodily fluids with others.@ That makes virgins most suitable for repairing the vampire's own degenerating genes.\

` It's just that vampires don't die from age as long as they take in the nutrients."\

`"The Dead Apostles suck blood because they need it to stay alive.@
` Immortality is a strain on their originally-human bodies.@
` The genes that compose their bodies are different… when they become vampires, they begin to degenerate at an incredible rate.@
` To make up for that, they must drain the blood of others in order to absorb genetic information and stabilize their own bodies.@ To a vampire, drinking blood is not like eating, but it's the minimum requirement for them to continue to exist."\

`"………"@
` This sounds complex.@ And long.@
` I can't follow the logic, but Arcueid nonetheless continues speaking.\

`"So, moving on.@
` The ability to bind someone with just a look is a type of Mystic Eyes.@ Eyes and words are both common types of magic circuits, so there are many vampires who have Mystic Eyes.@
` We usually possess the Mystic Eyes of Enchantment.@
` We don't enchant people by looking at them, rather, we enchant those who look into our eyes.@ A powerful vampire using Mystic Eyes can impose his own will into the brain of another and completely dominate their thoughts, but the Mystic Eyes of a Dead Apostle don't have that much power."\

`"What you call 'turning into mist' is really just making a spare body and controlling it via the will.@ Once the part serves its purpose, you cut the flow of magical energy to the offshoot and naturally, it returns to dust."\

` Wolves--and other animal transformations--are a byproduct of a vampire repairing its damaged body using its familiars.@
` For the long life of vampires, stabilizing their bodies with normal lives is not sufficient.@
` Humans are not fundamentally powerful animals, so it's more effective to repair one's body by absorbing beasts, as they surpass the human species in this respect.@
` Vampires who repair their own bodies with beasts can return those beasts to their previous forms and use them as familiars when they need to."\

` That time.@
` When Sensei gave me these glasses, she had told me something similar to what Arcueid said.@

` What I'm seeing are only lines, and not something as disturbing as death.\

`"What are you saying?@ What I see are just the lines where things can be cut."@
`"I'm telling you, those lines are the 'death' of the object.@
` Listen, Shiki.@ Everything in existence has an end.@ There are differences to when, but it's an end nonetheless.@
` Death does not 'arrive'.@ It is already contained within the object at its creation, and it's bound to happen someday.@
` This is what is called the principle of causality.@ You've heard of that before, right?\

` As long as something has an origin, it must have an end.@ When it will end is determined from its beginning.@ That's its so-called 'time of death'.@
` So, as it already exists from the beginning, it's not impossible for one to see it with their eyes, given that they can comprehend the concept of a 'time of death' and they have the appropriate circuit in their brain and eyes.\

` That's the truth behind those 'lines' you see.@
` This is nothing more than the general concept, but if I were to theorize, I would say that they are the weakest parts of the joints between the molecules in something, or perhaps a pre-designated switch within the genetic makeup that activates the death of that object."@

` In my own way, I understand what she is saying, but I don't want to believe any of it.\

`"--What?@ There's no way that sort of thing exists, let alone me being able to see it…!"@
`"Well, you are seeing it.@
` Usually, when you cut a living being's neck, they die.@ This means it stops because you've cut it.@
