` I hurry to the tea ceremony room.@
` Senpai has her hand on the door as I arrive.\

`"Senpai!"@

`"Ah, Tohno-kun.@ Are you going home now?"@
`"No, I thought I'd talk with you a little bit.@ You're going to have some tea now, right?@ I was thinking of joining you."@

`"No, I'm going home now.@ I have something to do, and this month club funding is getting a little low."@
`"---Ah.@ I see, all those tea snacks were bought with club money."@
` …… But, come to think of it, a club that can buy snacks with its own funds has to be wonderful.\

`"So I can't keep you company…… Tohno-kun, do you have any plans after this?"@
`"Me?@ No, not anymore."@
`"Well then, care to walk with me to the front gate?"@
`"Yeah, it would be my pleasure."@

` Senpai grins and nods, and walks by my side.@
` We decide to walk together for five minutes to the school gate.\

` Without any serious talk between us, we arrive at the school gate.@
`"Well then, see ya tomorrow, Senpai."@
` Raising one hand, I start off down the road in the opposite direction from her.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Oh, please wait.@ I have something I wanted to ask you, Tohno-kun."@
`"?@ What is it?"@
`"Yesterday, you said there was someone that looked like me.@ I kind of got curious, so I wanted to hear a bit more about it."@
` Her eyes burn with curiosity.@
` …… But to me, that's not something I really want to recall.\


`"…… Sorry, I don't want to talk about it.@ It was just a mistake I made, so it's okay."@

` I look away from Senpai as I give a vague excuse.@
`"Is that so?"@
` Senpai quickly ends her questioning.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"But you saw that person late at night, right?@
` …… Tohno-kun, I think walking around late at night like that is pretty dangerous.@ Those serial killings have been continuing, you know?@ If you meet that serial killer, that would be terrible, wouldn't it?"@
`"…… Senpai, you're worried about me walking out late at night?"@
`"---Yes.@ You're a good person, so you're the type that'll get easily tricked and put in danger."@
` Senpai looks like she is seriously worried.@
`"-----Nn."@
` Yes, her concern makes me extremely happy.\

`"Thanks Senpai.@ But it's alright, the one behind those incidents is gone."@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Eh?@ Gone?@ What do you mean?"@
` …… Crap, Nrvnqsr is a secret between just me and Arcueid.@
` I can't talk to Senpai about it, and besides, it's no use telling her about it.\

`"Um, yeah, that's right.@ It is dangerous to walk around at night, really."@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"…… Anyway, from now on, please stop walking around at night.@ You're a good student."@
`"Yeah, I know.@ I'm not sure about being a good student, but I won't play around at night anymore like you say."@
`"…………………"@
br
` Senpai stares at me.@
` ---Does she not believe me?@ She doesn't seem convinced.\

`"…… I get it.@ Then, I promise."@
` I stick out a hand.@
`"Senpai, I owe you one for that time, so I'll do as you ask.@ So it's a promise."@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Um……………… you want to, shake hands?"@
`"Yeah.@ We're a bit too old for pinkie promises, so we'll shake hands."@
`"…………………"@
` After standing there a little perplexedly, Senpai takes my outstretched hand.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"I understand.@ It's a promise, Tohno-kun."@
` She shakes my hand up and down.@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Well then, goodbye.@ Let's meet again at school tomorrow."@

` Wrapped up in the sunset, Senpai disappears.@
` After watching her go, I decide to head home, too.\

` I walk up the road and back to the mansion.@
` It's not quite six o'clock yet.@
` There's still an hour until dinner, so I'll kill some time in my room---\
