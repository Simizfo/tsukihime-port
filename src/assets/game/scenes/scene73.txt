`"Nothing.@ As a general rule, all the rooms except the ones we are using are locked.@
` Your room is at the back of the second floor of the west wing, and mine is in the east wing.@
` Hisui's room is right before the stairs on the west wing, second floor, and Kohaku's room is just before the west wing, first floor.@

`"The gaming room and the guest rooms next to the sitting room are closed, but I will open them if you decide to bring friends here.@
` The archives areâ€¦ well, there are some bad rumors going around about them, so currently they are off limits."@
