` It's lunchtime and the classroom starts to liven up.@
` Some guys are dashing off towards the cafeteria, a group of girls are rearranging desks to form a table, and some students are calmly leaving the classroom, boxed lunches in hand.@
` I watch them while I set down the milk and bread I bought.@

`"Sheesh, not much of an appetite as usual, huh, Tohno?"@
` This guy in front of me being here is already a part of my daily routine, and I'm not about to start complaining now.\

`"But man, what's up with us, just the two of us eating lunch together?@ What kind of meal goes unaccompanied by a beautiful blossom?"@
`"If you don't have any 'blossoms', why don't you join that group over there?@ I'm not going to stop you."@
`"Idiot!@ When I say 'blossom', I mean a single, beautiful blossom.@ Those girls making a group aren't good.@ They're poisonous, rather than being beautiful."@
` …… Arihiko's comment would've probably earned him some rocks thrown in his direction if the group of girls had heard him.@
` Luckily, the girls in our class didn't hear his poisonous words.\

`"…… That's pretty harsh, Arihiko.@ I know you were a bad guy before, but haven't you been getting worse lately?@ You're surpassing merely 'bad' and getting into 'deviant'."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I can't help it, can I?@ When there's a truly beautiful blossom at our school, my discerning eye grows more critical."@
`"Hah…… So, who is this beautiful 'blossom'?"@
`"That's a secret.@ I don't want more competition, now do I?"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` Arihiko laughs with an ambitious smile spilling over his face.@
` As it is something I don't have, I'm a little impressed by his ability to express himself so frankly.\
br
` ----And then.@
br
` The person I just met comes in from the classroom door.@
`"…… Ah."@
` With a boxed lunch in one hand, there is no way I could mistake her---

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Hello, Tohno-kun.@ Mind if I interrupt?"@
`"Eh---Ah, it's fine, of course---"@
` Smiling, Ciel-senpai brings over a chair and sits down naturally.\
`"Um…… Senpai, are you hurt?"@
`"No, I'm not hurt at all."@
` Even her smiling reply troubles me.@

`"You said to come here at lunchtime, so I thought it would be rude if I did not."@
`"Uh…… It's true that I said that, but……"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` What I intended to say was that she could come and I would take responsibility if she ended up being hurt.\

`"S-s-senpaiiii!"@
` Arihiko slams the table with a bang as he stands up.@

`"Ah, Inui-kun.@ Could it be that you and Tohno-kun are acquainted?"@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yeah, we're more than casual acquaintances!@ Tohno and I have been friends since we were kids!@ Right, Tohno?@ You could even say we were best friends!"@
`"--------"@
` Arihiko makes a tight fist for emphasis.@
` There's no room for agreement or disagreement.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, really?@ It is such a coincidence that you two are friends!"@
`"It sure is!@ This bastard has such a calm face, I'm wondering just when did he start to get along with Senpai!"@
` 'Hahaha!' Arihiko glares at me while laughing towards Senpai.@
` Absent-mindedly, I wonder if that's what you'd call being well-rounded.\

` In the end, Arihiko forcibly convinces Senpai to stay for lunch.@
` Well…… since she brought her lunch, perhaps that's what she had in mind in the first place.@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, Inui-kun, do you live by yourself?"@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Nah, I live with my sister.@ Our parents left us in charge of the house, so we naturally learned how to cook, that's all."@
` Arihiko seems familiar with Senpai.@
` He's able to talk to her more casually than I can.@ I've only met her a few times.\
`"By the way, Senpai, you said that you were called here by Tohno.@ Did something happen?"@
`"Yes, I ran into Tohno-kun during the break.@ I wasn't hurt, but Tohno-kun hit his head."@
`"Hmm…… And you came to see him because you became worried?"@
`"Yes, that's about right."@

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

` Senpai's voice is brisk and pleasant to listen to.@
` Since listening is more interesting than talking, I keep silent.\
` That's when Arihiko directs the conversation towards me.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What's wrong, Tohno?@ Running into someone…… Don't tell me your anemia was acting up again?"@
` Arihiko's voice betrays his deep concern about my health.@
`"…… No, it's not that.@ I was running to the office to deal with some details for me moving.@ That's when I ran into Senpai."@
`"---Really?@ Well, I guess your carelessness was at fault."@
` Arihiko folds his arms and nods in agreement to himself.\

`"Tohno-kun, are you changing schools!?"@
` Senpai suddenly outbursts almost hysterically.@
` …… Really, why does she think I'm changing schools just because of that?@
`"I'm not changing schools, Senpai.@ I'm just changing my place of residence, so I filed the paperwork for a change of address."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Um…… so that means you're going to be living alone?"@
`"No, I'm just going back to my real home.@
` It's that fancy place on top of the hill.@ I still can't quite believe it yet."\
`"Ohh…… Could that possibly be the Tohno-san mansion?"@
` Senpai asks with some hesitation.@
` The western-style house on top of the hill is probably seen as something special to the residents of the town.@
` I haven't been there for eight years, but even in my memories, the Tohno mansion was ridiculously large.\

`"Yeah, that's right.@ I don't think it's the right place for me either, but it's too late now that I'm done moving."@

`"Hmm…… You don't seem too happy about it."@
`"It's not a particularly good or bad thing.@ I don't really understand it myself."@
`"Well, even if it is your house, it's been eight years, right?@ I can understand if you're feeling restless.@ It'll probably feel like someone else's house for a while."@
`"I wonder if that's so…… I haven't gone back yet, so I don't know.@ Well, I'm a bit relaxed, since I've always got a refuge at your place."\
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Hmph.@ Listen, you, I'm not impressed with how you come to stay at my house every time something bad happens.@ I like your personality trait of not standing out, but I've hated how you're always too reserved for a long time now!"@
` Arihiko strikes the table with a bang again.@
`"…………"@
` Well, everything Arihiko said is true, so there's no way to fight back.@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Inui-kun, does Tohno-kun really stay at your house that often?"@
`"Yeah, he does.@ That damn Tohno is too reserved toward his parents and he would come to my place every long vacation.@ He's reserved toward them cause they're taking care of him."\
`"That's why he comes over to my place, where we conveniently have an empty room.@ Since he looks pretty decent, my sister took a liking to him, and he shamelessly comes to stay with us without paying a cent!"@
` Arihiko's fist trembles, as if to say 'unforgivable!'@

`"It's okay.@ You didn't say anything wrong."@
` I continue to eat my bread without looking at Arihiko.\

` Arihiko nods to himself in agreement.@
` His overwhelming optimism is something I am truly envious of.\

`"Tohno-kun, um…… did you not get along with your previous family?"@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, that's not it.@ This guy had no problem with the Arimas.@ Oh, the Arimas were the family who took care of him.@ They're really nice people, and from what I could see, they're a happy family.@
` Even so, he refused to be their adopted child, and he escaped to my place every vacation.@ Sheesh…… just what were you not satisfied with, anyway?"@
`"There's nothing I wasn't satisfied with.@ It's just that I've received so much from them already, I didn't want to be a further burden on them."\

`"Um, I'm sorry if I'm wrong about this, but have you been walking around at night in the business district lately?"@
`"Huh---?"@
` Business district……?@
` I rarely go there even in the daytime, let alone at night.@
` Her question is so entirely off that I become interested instead.@

`"Hmmm…… At night, you say?@ Around what time?"@
`"From what I've heard, past midnight."\
` Midnight…… then that rules it out completely.@
` I occasionally go out to the business district at night to buy something, but I've never been out into the city that late before.@

`"That's definitely not me.@ My household is old-fashioned, so they've got a curfew at seven.@ You can't get in after that even if you cry.@ Since I don't want to have to camp outside, I try to my death to get home before seven."@
` I'm upfront in denying Yumizuka's question.@
` She smiles happily.\

`"Yeah, I know.@ The Arima family is also the head of a style of tea ceremony.@ That's right, it must be really strict for you, Tohno-kun."@
`"Not so much strict as they like to tease me…… eh?@ Yumizuka-san, you seem to know quite a bit?@ Are you a student of it?"@
`"No.@ I don't really know that much about tea ceremony.@ I have a friend who goes there and she told me it was really strict."@
`"Oh, but Yumizuka-san, how did you know I lived with the Arimas?@ I haven't even told anyone here at our high school."\

`"You've forgotten that we went to the same middle school together, haven't you?"@
` Yumizuka giggles as she speaks.@
`"Eh----?"@
` …… We went to the same middle school……?@
` I can't remember, so I can't say anything, but if that's true,
` then it wouldn't be odd if she knew I was entrusted to the Arimas.@
`"Yumizuka-san, maybe, um……"@
