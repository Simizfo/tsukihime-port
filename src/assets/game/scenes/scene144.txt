` Back then, the whole mansion was like a giant playground.@
br
` The garden, a deep forest.@
` The house, a tall castle.@
br
` We played in our own little world, which would take days to explore.\

` Every day was fun.@
` No one thought about ever growing up,
` and we believed that days and nights would always be the same.@
br
` It was just a childhood spent playing like puppies.@
` We got along wonderfully, and were the best of playmates.\

` Whenever I turned back, Akiha would be there, waving her hands and hiding shyly.@
` Yes, always the same.\

` I slowly awaken and open my eyes.@
` The morning light wraps around me and my sleepiness starts to lift.@
br
` As the last vestiges clear,
` I sense that I had a very nostalgic dream.@

` As soon as I open my eyes, I start to see those terrible things jump into my vision.@
` My head stabs with pain.@
`"Gg----"@
` I scramble for the glasses by my pillow and put them on.\

` I take in some air.@
` After taking a few deep breaths, I manage to calm down.@
`"Why did I----so early…"@
` See those lines so clearly this early in the morning?@
` It's difficult to see the lines of death in buildings.@
` It's usually hard to see them, and seeing them so clearly like I just did now is rare.@
`"…………"@
` What's more, I even saw those "points".@
` I think my headache is getting worse too.\

` Sensei said these eyes would attract things that weren't good.@
` I think Arcueid and these vampires are certainly not good.@
` So, maybe it's all affecting my eyes and making them stronger.@
br
`"----Can't be."@
` I'm probably just tired.\



`"Huh----?"@
` Come to think of it, Hisui isn't here.@
` It's already past seven.@
` Normally she would have already come in and woke me up.@
br
`"…… Maybe Hisui slept in."@
` But I see my freshly prepared uniform on my desk.@
`"What's this?@ Maybe she had some other duties."@
` I'm a little curious, but I guess it doesn't concern me.@
` I don't have time this morning, so I should just hurry up, change and go to the sitting room.\

`"------Ah."@
` As I go from the lobby towards the sitting room, I realize I forgot something terribly important.@
` I open the door and stand there, without taking a single step forward.\

` Normally she would say,
`"Good morning, Nii-san,"@
` no matter how angry she might be, but she doesn't even look at me this morning.@
`"Ah……… uh."@
` It goes without saying.@
` Arcueid's coming here last night has some very lasting repercussions.\

` Akiha's irritation is permeating the air.@ You could practically cut the tension with a knife.@
