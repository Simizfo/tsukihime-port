` No matter what, I can't talk myself out of what happened last night.@
` The only method I have left is to apologize before Akiha can do anything.\


`"Akiha, about last night, that---"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Nii-san, can I warn you about something?"@
br
` ---And then,
` before I can apologize, Akiha speaks those words in a frightening voice.\

`"You are the eldest son of the Tohno family, so it is better if you do not apologize for wayward actions.@
` Apologizing is admitting you did something wrong.@ In that situation, the eldest son has to receive a proper punishment, yes?"@
`"-----Um, Akiha, well…"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Nii-san, I don't want to have to do that to you.@ So Nii-san, I'm waiting for a wonderful excuse."\

`"------"@
br
` …… A devil.@
` I see a devil.\

`"Akiha, before that, I'd like to eat some breakfast in the dining room.@ Is that okay?"@
` I retreat to the dining room.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----Nii-san."@
` Her voice stops me dead in my tracks.@
` Uh-oh…… whatever happens, it seems like she won't let me get away.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I have something to discuss with you before breakfast.@ Please, sit there on the sofa."@
`"…… Got it.@ Please keep it as short as possible."@
` I plop down on the sofa across from her.@
` Kohaku-san brings me a teacup.@
` Her smile seems to say "Hang in there, okay?" and I'm able to gather up at least a little courage.@
` I drink a mouthful of tea and meet her gaze.\


`"So, what'd you want to talk about, Akiha?"@
`"That woman last night, just what is she to you?"@
br
` ---Guh!!@
br
` That was close.@
` Akiha's normally so roundabout, but this time she asks straight on.@
` I'm taken so much by surprise I almost sprayed tea everywhere.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san, did you hear me?"@
`"Yeah, I hear you.@ Loud and clear."@
`"Then please answer.@ That woman from last night, just what is she to you, Nii-san?"@
`"……… Um, that is a troubling question, um, she's a friend, a person I agreed to help---"\

`"A friend so important you had to leave in the middle of the night?@ Yes, I don't intend to have to approve of all the relationships you have, but you are in school now, correct?@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t16a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` The eldest son of the Tohno-family, going to places with some strange woman in the middle of the night… please stop doing such shameless things."\
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


` As she speaks, her cheeks flush and she looks away.@
br
` ---I see, Akiha thinks my relationship with Arcueid is like that.\

`"Wait Akiha.@ There's really nothing between us.@ I'm just helping her find something.@ After that, we won't even see each other again."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh really?@ You certainly seem very close.@ That must be my imagination, right Nii-san?"@
` Her gaze is cold.@
` …… If I lie with something like "That's not it," things will be much easier, but---more than the fact that I don't want to lie to Akiha, I really don't want to say that we aren't close.\

`"----That, may not…… be your imagination, maybe."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Right.@ You were panicking like I've never seen you before.@ You were never serious about anything and now you show all this emotion, just what's gotten into you?"@
`"That's not it.@ I was just totally caught off guard that she'd actually come here."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"That woman calmly waited for you the whole time, Nii-san."@
` She casts a sideways glare at me.@
` She really seems convinced that Arcueid and I are dating.\

`"Look, Akiha.@ You're getting it completely wrong.@ In the first place, we first met---"@
br
` by me killing her, but I swallow the rest of those words.@
` …… It'll be too stupid to tell the truth.@
` But I can't even think of a good excuse, and I can only stammer.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"If you cannot answer then let's change the question.@ You've been calling that woman "her" this whole time, what is her name?"@
`"…… Um, Arcueid."@
`"I see.@ So you did not meet at school.@ There are no foreign exchange students at your high school."@
`"…… Uh."@
` Like Akiha says, there's no one from overseas at my school.@
` It's right, but why does she know that much?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"So Nii-san, just where in the world did you meet a person like that?"@
`"In the city.@ Just, a coincidence."@
`"Oh, a coincidence?@ Then Arcueid must have talked to you?"@
`"Ah---No, I was the one, who talked to her……"@
` Well, not quite talked, but I was the one that initiated our contact.\

`"Why did you talk to her?@ I thought Arcueid-san was nothing to you.@ Or did you only intend it like that from the beginning?"@
br
` Her questions are right on the mark.@
` Step by step, she draws closer to my secret.@
` Like a snake staring at a frog, she ignores all my excuses and is trying to drive me into a corner.@
br
` I can now only use force to end this conversation.\

`"That's enough.@ I said she's nothing to me!@
` Besides, whatever I do doesn't concern you.@ You don't have any right to complain about who I date, anyway."@
` I point at her directly.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` After giving an angered face----she stands up without a sound.@
`"----?"@
` …… That's odd.@
` I thought she would yell back at me, but instead she appears very uncomfortable and looks away.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Even I, didn't want to say this.@ But it's just, I get a bad feeling from her.@
` If it was anyone else, I would just be resigned to it.@ But, for you to be ensnared by her, doesn't that make me just a big fool?"@
` …… I don't know why.@
` But she regretfully bites her lip as she says these words.\

`"That's why I'm saying she's nothing special.@ What's wrong Akiha, you seem a little strange."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"That's enough.@ If you want to do as you please, then feel free, Nii-san……!"@
cl c,%type_lshutter_fst
` Akiha storms noisily out the lobby.@
`"………?"@
` I don't understand anything at all.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Oh, Shiki-san, that was horrible of you."@
` Kohaku-san gives a disappointed sigh and starts walking after her.@
`"Poor Akiha-sama.@ If you are going to bring your lover, please bring someone more normal.@ If you did that, Akiha-sama would have understood."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid
` Kohaku-san disappears towards the lobby after Akiha.\
