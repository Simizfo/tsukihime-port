` Akiha doesn't say anything when she sees me and sips her tea quietly.\

`"Good morning, Akiha."@
` Resisting the urge to go to school, I greet her as naturally as possible.@
` Akiha's eyebrow twitches as she places her teacup down and slowly looks at me.\

`"Good morning Nii-san.@ It was quite late when you came home last night, wasn't it?"@
`"…… No, not really.@
` It was at most a little past one o'clock, quite normal for a healthy young man in high school to be up, right?"@
`"I see.@ My bedtime is also past midnight so I was up at that time.@ But I would come home much earlier than that."\

`"Yeah, even I was home earlier, wasn't I?@ …… I just had something to do, so I was out for a little bit---"@

`"Uh……"@
` Her stare is pure ice.@
` …… This is the second time, and I'm sure even though Akiha looks calm, she is quite angry.\

`"--Nii-san.@
` I don't know what went on at the Arima house, but here the curfew is eight o'clock.@ It is a rule that must not be broken.@
` The gate will be locked after that, so please don't climb in like a robber."@
`"Oh----you knew?"\

`"…… The surveillance camera showed me quite clearly.@
` It is a good thing Kohaku-san realized it was you and turned off the alarm system because otherwise you would probably be detained right now, Tohno Shiki."\
`"…… Oh.@ I should thank Kohaku-san then.@
` And, um, Akiha, I'm sorry.@ I shouldn't have kept quiet about it."\

`"…… If you understand, then it is fine.@ Please make sure you observe your curfew from now on.@ I will overlook it this time."@
`"…… About that, Akiha."@
`"What is it?"@
`"…… This is a little hard to say.@ I… have something to do tonight too.@ I don't know when I will be back, but I'm not going to do anything bad---"\
