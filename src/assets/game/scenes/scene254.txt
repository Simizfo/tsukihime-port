` Why didn't I notice such a simple mistake?@
` The victims of the serial killings are found with their bodies drained of blood.@
` But Nrvnqsr was different.@
` He didn't leave any dead bodies behind.@ He not only drank the blood, but also ate the meat, leaving no trace.@
` To prove it, the people eaten by him in the hotel were treated as missing people, not killed people.@
` So---that means, it is something completely different.\

`"Wait.@ Then what is the serial killing going on right now?@ Just who is doing it?"@

`"That's a different vampire than Nrvnqsr.@ To be more specific, that vampire is why I came here, and Nrvnqsr came here following me.@ It's that sort of correlation."@
`"---Wha… So the one you're after wasn't Nrvnqsr after all……!?"\

`"Yes, I didn't ever say he was my initial target.@ I was his target, but he was never my target; my target is the one called the 'serial killer' in this city."@
`"Wha-----"@
` I gasp in shock.@
` But---it really is just as she says.@
` She said her purpose is to kill vampires, so I just thought it was Nrvnqsr she was after----\

`"…… So what is it?@ Killing Nrvnqsr that night, was pointless………!?"@
`"It wasn't pointless, you fought in my place.@ Well, if you didn't kill me, you probably wouldn't have had to in the first place."@
`"------"@
` I feel a little dizzy.\

`"…… In other words, those vampire killings had nothing at all to do with Nrvnqsr and it was the work of another vampire……?"@

`"Yeah, that's right.@ But, that's my problem so you don't have to worry about it.@ But more than that, hey."\
