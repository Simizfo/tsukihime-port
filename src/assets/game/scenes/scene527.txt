` ----Dismissed.@
` …… Oh, geez, okay!@
` Each heroine has two different kinds of endings.@
` This is Ciel-san's Good End.@
` Please return to a previous choice and choose a different story!@
` That will be the True End!\


` Oh, and one more thing.@
` Ciel-san's and Arcueid's routes are the Near Side of the Moon routes.@ But there is also a completely different story: the Far Side of the Moon route.@
` It is the "Tohno Family" route, associating with people like Akiha-san.@
` It seems difficult to know what requirement is needed to be able to choose that route, so I will give you a little hint.\

` On the first day, you should not go meet Ciel-san.@
br
` It might be better to stay in your classroom during lunch.@
br
` And most importantly.@
` I think that if you don't meet the vampire called Nrvnqsr, this current storyline will never happen.@
` So first, how to cause the new storyline.@
` During that specific time, if you do not try to perform that one action, a completely different event should be waiting for you.@
br
` Well then, let's meet again once more in the main story!\
