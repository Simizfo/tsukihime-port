` …… This is just a bad dream.@
` But somehow, this stench of blood smells so horribly real.\
`"…… Wro… ng…"@
` Yes.@
` Wrong wrong wrong wrong.@
` Wrong wrong wrong wrong.@
` But.@
` I killed her.@ Is that fact wrong?\
` I didn't kill her.@ Is that fact wrong?\
br
` Yes, I---
br
`    Tohno Shiki    wanted to kill    that girl.@
br
` That's what I wanted to do back then.@
` Just that, it was all so muddy inside my head, I didn't put it into words.\
`"Wro----ng!"@
br
` I feel like throwing up from the smell of blood.@
br
`"Ah---guh!"@
br
` The contents of my stomach rise in my throat.@

`"Ah---ah!"@
br
` The crimson is soaking into my eyeballs.@
br
` I feel dizzy.@
` I fall down on my knees into the red sea of blood.\
`"Ah---Guh……!"@
` My gastric juices come up.@
` I throw everything back up.@
` My food, my gastric juices, everything, while I cry.@
` There is nothing left in my stomach.@
` But my body continues to force me to throw up, as if trying to undo what had occurred and return me to a normal life.@
br
` Guuh----burgh!@
br
` Pain.@
` It hurts, like my insides are burning.\
` The tears won't stop, and my body collapses to the floor like a pile of garbage.@
` My knees sink into the red puddle spread all over the floor.@
` Red starts to stain my body.@
` It's so painful and red; it's like I'm dreaming.\
`"Ah-----Aaah……!"@
` I keep crying.@
` The fact that I killed someone is making me sad.@
` …… No.@ That's not right.@
` I am sad because I killed her without reason, like breaking apart a doll.@
br
` ---I don't understand.@
br
` Why I feel like this,
` Why I killed her without reason.@
` I can't find the reason.\

`"--------It's a lie."@
` It doesn't feel real.@
` So this is just one of those dreams I have when I faint.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`"------It's a lie."@
` Besides, how can someone cut apart someone like that with just a knife.@
` I read it in a book once.@
` It takes a whole day of strenuous labor to cut someone up, even when using a saw.@
` That's why there's no way I could have possibly done such a thing with just a knife.@
` These "lines" never existed in the first place.@ Everything was just a delusion I had fallen for--\

` Guh---ffpt.@
br
` Gastric juice drips over my lips.@
` Passing out of my mouth, dripping down my jaw.@
` Mixed with the juices is something red.@
` My throat is probably bleeding because my stomach keeps trying to throw up even when there's nothing left in there.@
br
`"O…… u----"@
br
` It hurts.@
` That's why this…
` This isn't a dream, and I'm just lying to myself.\

`"---It's all lies."@
` Yes, actually, I understand everything.@
` I lusted after her.@ Just looking at her aroused me.@
` When I cut her apart, it was so thrilling I almost ejaculated.\
` These eyes, too.@
` If I knew these "lines" could cut things apart like paper being shredded…
` I should have understood that even a person could easily be cut apart like I just did to her.@
` I had lived a normal life without even thinking about something like that.@
br
` ---If I really am the sort of dangerous person who could easily kill just about anything…
` Then I should have put out these eyes or lived a life without seeing anyone.\

` I don't know.@
` There isn't even a trace of that impulse left.@
` The thought of holding back never crossed my mind.@
` I didn't even consider trying to stop myself.@
`"Kill this girl."@
` It had seemed like the obvious thing to do, and I went through with it.\
` Then the answer is simple.@
` I must be insane.@
br
` I've probably been mad since eight years ago, when I miraculously came back to life from a fatal accident-------
