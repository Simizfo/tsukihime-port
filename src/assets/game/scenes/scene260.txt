`"The Dead are like that.@ When humans have their blood sucked by a vampire, they can also receive some of the vampire's blood.@
` They die, but remain in this world as a servant of the vampire.@ They are called The Dead and they are like the vampire's familiars.@
` Ah, maybe it's easier to understand if I use the word zombie.@ It's closer to the voodoo belief in Haiti where the white serpent-god Damballah is invoked to control a dead body, but let's just say a dead body that moves is a zombie, okay?"@

`"---I'm still confused though.@ Why would a vampire do that?@
` Killing people---not letting them die but controlling them, what bad taste."\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"You're right, those vampires do have bad taste.@ But that's something only the Dead Apostles do.@ Those that were always vampires from the very beginning do not do such things."@
br
`"----?"@
` Always vampires from the very beginning ……?@
br
`"---I remember.@ You said there's two types of vampires, those who were vampires originally, and those who were humans.@
` …… When I heard that before, it kind of stuck in my head, I thought it was a little odd.@ So what exactly do you mean by those who weren't originally vampires?"\

`"Simple, I'm just saying that Dead Apostles used to be humans.@ They either gained immortality through magic or became servants of the True Ancestors that sucked their blood.@
` …… Shiki, you said it was bad taste to use killed humans, but that's just the least of it.@ There are other vampires who think up worse games."@
`"---A game---what is that?@ You guys kill for fun, and use their dead bodies as toys……!?"\

`"…… I won't deny that.@
` For vampires, "amusement" is the same as breathing.@ For those who were once human but gain imperfect immortality, their greatest enemy is boredom.@
` They didn't have a reason to become immortal to start with, so once they gained immortality, they lost all kinds of greed.@
` Their goal was immortality itself, so I guess that's just the way things are."\

`"----They're bored so they want to play?@ Don't be ridiculous.@ Isn't it enough that they won't age or die?@ Do they really need anything else?"\
`"That's what I said, they got everything they wanted.@ After that, there is no meaning to existence.@
` As soon as someone realizes they have no value---that their life is stopped, then their meaning of existence disappears too.@
` Immortality is also another word for death."\


`"So they started to wear down and they started to create their own amusement, as if to tell themselves they could have fun as long as they lived.@ ---That's their beginning.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"They copy humans and see themselves in a game as lords of a castle expanding their territory.@
` I guess you could call it a country of The Dead.@ It seems they got more enjoyment out of that than they expected."@
br
` …… She speaks as if she was talking of other people.@
` Arcueid should be one of those, but she certainly doesn't seem like she has that sort of hobby.\

`"Well, we'll change the topic, but the Dead Apostles were originally human.@
` There are a few cases where they became vampires through their own magical research, but the majority of them were humans who had their blood sucked.@
` They are immortal, but they can't last forever.@ They can only be immortal if they drink the blood of others.@
` Didn't I say their immortality was imperfect?@ If they can't feed on humans then their immortality is gone."\

`"But, if they openly fed on humans, then the existence of "vampires" would be revealed.@ Even if they don't, just by being there, they distort the world around them.@ That would attract the attention of agents of The Church, like Ciel."@
`"…… Um, so you mean that vampires can't do what they want?"\

`"Yes, if they break their agreement with The Church and move about freely, they would be immediately discovered and annihilated.@
` So the majority of the Dead Apostles make subordinates that can bring them blood as they sleep.@
` Sucking blood and giving the dead body some blood of their own, they create their minions who do their work for them.@ We simply call those "The Dead."\

`"…… Hmm…… So what you killed before was kind of like a soldier for the Dead Apostles?"@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Not so much a soldier as a puppet.@ The Dead Apostles control the dead bodies by skipping the process of becoming a vampire.@ The Dead are completely connected to their parent vampire.@
` In order for them to survive, they attack others to eat their flesh, but more than half of that energy goes to their master.@
` Like a queen bee nourished by the worker bees, the Dead Apostles can use The Dead to increase their power while they sleep."\

` Then, the minimal Dead he sent out was that man from before, huh.\

`"So, searching further tonight will be useless, I think."@
`"…… Well, I don't mind.@ It is tedious though."@
`"Yeah, hunting vampires is tedious work.@ We have to find the coffin of this 'enemy' somewhere in this city, so it won't be easy."@

` Arcueid lets go of my hand and jumps back softly.\

`"Arcueid……?"@

`"Let's say goodbye for tonight.@ We'll meet tomorrow.@
` With her dance-like steps, she watches me as she gets farther away.@
`"Tomorrow---wait, where should we meet……!?"@

`"Here's fine.@ The time---yeah, around ten o'clock should be fine."@
` With a smile, she makes that promise.\


`"Good night, Shiki.@ I'll see you here tomorrow!"@
` And,
` waving her hand, Arcueid disappears.\

` ---I get back to the mansion.@
` It's about one-thirty in the morning.@
` The mansion is completely dark.@

br
`"……… This can't be good."@
` I put my hand on the mansion gate.@
` Ka-chang.@
` A sturdy chain holds it closed.@
br
`"---Dang.@ I shouldn't cut this."@
` I think a bit.@
` Then, I decide to climb over the gate.\

` …… I'm exhausted.@
` After sneaking over the wall like a thief, I quietly make my way to the doorway.@
` The gate was locked, but the door isn't.@
`"…… It must have been Hisui."@
` I give a sigh of thanks.@
br
` So as not to wake Akiha, Kohaku-san or Hisui, I sneak my way through the mansion.\

`"------Whew."@
` Letting out a breath, I lay down on my bed.@
`"………………"@
` My promise to Arcueid.@
` Maybe it's fate, but you've gotten yourself tangled up in trouble again, Tohno Shiki.@
br
`"----Could I help it?@ I just can't leave her alone."@
` Or maybe I didn't want to leave her alone?@
`"Well…… I do like Arcueid."@
` But is that love?@
` I don't even know my feelings.\

` At any rate, it looks like I'll be helping Arcueid once again starting tomorrow.@
` So for now, I shouldn't think of anything else but getting a good night's sleep----\

`   The first feeling was rather one of pity.@
!w1000

\
br
` Not anger, not despair.@
` Just, I thought everything before my eyes was pitiful.@ (Of course, the most pitiful thing is myself.)\

` Life which breaks down without limit.@
` Daily life which fades without limit.@
` Time which is forgotten without limit.@
br
` Everyone only falls.@
` And yet everyone still struggles desperately to continue existing, and when they judge that it is not possible, they continue to reproduce.@
` Continuing to reproduce.@
` In the end, even that dies, but there is no recompensation.\

` Of course, it is not those who die who are not recompensated.@
` We had no hope to begin with.@
` What is not recompensated are the attempts.@
` The noble wish, the yearning for eternity which everyone longs for yet can not achieve.@
br
` I have no interest whatsoever in the things that break down.@
` If I could see death and understand it, maybe I'll take a bit of an interest.\

br
` A repetition nearly impossible to measure, yet this wish repeats itself.@
` I thought to replace this almost-comical cycle of wishes with one pure thing.@
br
` There is no need to state the method.@
` A wish becomes a result after it is granted.@
br
` I lived solely for that reason.@
` It could not be termed "conviction".@
` Just, the first word I learned happened to be "eternity".\

` …… Oh?@ So you intend to get the eternity closest to you?\

` Of course not.@ They are only a species that age slower and die harder.@ I am becoming one of them only because this body has reached its limit.@ If I am to go farther on, it will take time in this body.\

` It's ironic that you, the one that goes after eternity, hurries with things.@
` So you plan on leaving here tomorrow?\

` I'll leave the Burial Agency to you.@ In the first place, there is only one empty seat for the priesthood.@ I used up all my father's inheritance getting this far, so it is about time I quit.\

` …… Well, that's fine.@ So you are going to complete your magic theory.@ I have no intention of leaving here, and I can't live with you.@ Well, fortunately, I am a woman.@ I'll quickly bear a child and tell it all about you.\

` Oh?@ What will you tell it, Narbarek?\

` Let's see.@ I'll tell it something like--After around a hundred years, another newcomer Dead Apostle will appear.@ It is pointless to take notice of him, so ignore him.\

` No, you wouldn't need to wait a hundred years.@ Just like here, I will rise quickly to the top.@ This body will become the most superior vampire, so ten years will be enough.\

` How foolish.@ Even if it is you, you would need at least a hundred years if you start over from The Dead.@ Their world's intensity is nowhere as nice as ours.\

` Using direct methods, then you would be right.@
` But if I become the strongest vampire from the very beginning, their world's rules will not apply to me.\

` …… What do you mean by that?\

` It is simple.@
` As a priest of The Church, you certainly know that Dead Apostles' powers are affected by the True Ancestor that sucked their blood.@
` Therefore---the solution is very simple.@
br
br
` If I wish to become the strongest Dead Apostle,
` this blood of mine,
` it must be sucked by the strongest of the True Ancestors---\
