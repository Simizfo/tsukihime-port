` ----And then,
` I embrace Akiha's body from the front.\

` ---There's no way I could kill her.@
br
`"…… I want you to live."@
` Akiha tilts her head questioningly.@
`"No matter what you become---I still want you to live, Akiha."@
br
` My tears cannot be stopped.@
` Akiha hugs back joyfully---and bites on my neck.\

`"-----!!"@
` It hurts.@
` But it is not an act to suck my blood.@
` It is just a primitive act to bite me.\
`"A-Akiha."@
` Akiha just frantically bites my neck.@
` She tears off the meat and my bones are being chipped away.@
` Akiha has no intelligence.@
` She does not know who is holding her, or the meaning of an embrace.@
br
` Akiha is no different from a beast in human form.@
` But still----\

`"---Still…… I want you to live."@
` …… Is it wrong to wish such a thing?@
` Is it a crime to wish for her to stay alive even though she goes around killing people?@
` Even if Akiha says she cannot endure such a thing, I want her to endure past it.\
br
` ----Even if.@
` To think that the crime is borne by me is selfish thinking.\

`"…… I'll save you."@
` Hard.@
` With all my might, I embrace Akiha.@
`"Uh, uhhh, uhh!!"@
` I embrace the wildly moving Akiha.@
` Crunch.@
` She breaks my shoulder bone by biting through it.\

`"------A, Akiha-------"@
` Even though one of my shoulder's bones is broken, I embrace Akiha with one arm.@
`"Ugh!!@ Uhnn………!!"@
` Akiha rages wildly.@
` I embrace her for a long time.@
` …… Is it because this might be our last embrace?@
` I have never held someone so dearly, trying to remember everything… their heartbeat, their warmth…\

`"Uh…… Mm……"@
` …… Maybe since she found out I am not going to do anything, Akiha stops fighting.@
br
` I don't know how long we were like this in the falling autumn leaves.@
` But Akiha has fallen asleep in my arms.\

`"………………"@
` I rest Akiha's body on the ground as gently as I can.@
` Akiha's hair is still red.@
` If SHIKI's words are true, then…
` There is no way for it to return it to black except for that one method.\

`"………………"@
` I swore I would save her, no matter what happened.@
` It's really easy to save her.@
` The reason why Akiha is living as one of the Tohno Blood.@
` If the human she is sharing her life with disappears, she can go back to the original "Tohno Akiha".@
` But that means---the death of Tohno Shiki.\

` I don't know what leads to happiness or what can save us.@
` I don't know if death can be the way to save her.@
` But right now, I can't tell what is the right thing to do.@
