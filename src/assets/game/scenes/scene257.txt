` The previously dark lamp posts spring back to life.@
` The park lit only by the moonlight gradually becomes brighter.\

`"It seems that woman lifted her barrier.@ It was supposed to prevent anyone from entering the park, but it seems like you could pass right through."@
`"Hm?@ You mean that power outage was Senpai's doing?"@

`"By the way Shiki.@ I wanna ask, but what do you think of Ciel?"@
` With a cold voice, Arcueid suddenly asks that.\

`"…… About Senpai?@ …… Why do you ask about that, Arcueid?"@
`"Oh nothing.@ I just hate that woman.@ We were supposed to meet and exchange information, but I got irritated during the conversation and we ended up trying to kill each other."@
`"K-kill each other---why did you end up doing that!?@ In the first place, Senpai isn't a vampire.@ Why did you try to kill Senpai?"\

`"That's right.@ She said 'I knew it was pointless, I just can't allow your existence', and then she attacked me.@ She may look very calm, but all the members of the Burial Agency enjoy fighting.@ You can't let her fool you too, Shiki."@

`"---Shiki.@ You were fooled by her up to now, right?@ So why are you saying things to help her out?@
` You know, she was tricking you, since you didn't know anything, and pretended to be a normal person.@ Don't you feel a little angry at being used?"@
` Arcueid glares at me.@
`"……………"@
` That is,
` certainly I'm shocked that Senpai is different from normal people, kind of like Arcueid.@
` But, I don't feel like I've been tricked.@ On the contrary, Senpai has helped me so many times.\

`"I----"@
` …… Even though I know about Senpai's identity now, I still think of her as Senpai.@
` Eating lunch with her, talking about stupid things with her and Arihiko, walking with her to the school gate, all of it is so much fun.@

` Her eyes are the source.@
` Now she isn't like a human, but more like an animal hunting its prey.@
` It seems Ciel-senpai is an unforgivable enemy for Arcueid.@
` That's why she glares at me with such fierce, hostile eyes.@
` As if saying, if I am her enemy's friend, I will be Arcueid's enemy as well.\
