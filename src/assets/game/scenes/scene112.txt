` ---I'll try telling the truth.@

` I don't want to lie to Akiha, and if I explain everything sincerely, Akiha may understand.@
` …… Well, the possibility of that is like winning a lottery.@
br
`"--Alright, let's go."@
` Taking a deep breath, I open the sitting room door.\

` In the sitting room, Akiha is on the sofa and Hisui is standing by the wall.@

`"---Good morning, Nii-san."@
` Her gaze is telling me, "I am angry."@
`"Yo, morning, Akiha."@
` A defiant person is strong.@
` I give a cheerful greeting to Akiha's bullying gaze.\

`"----"@
` She might be confused with my cheerfulness, as she just stares at me.@

`"Nii-san, let's dispense with the greetings.@ Please sit here; I wish to speak with you."@
`"Sure.@ Let's keep it short though."@
` I solemnly and calmly sit down on the sofa across from Akiha.\

`"Well then, Nii-san.@ This is very abrupt, but may I ask about these past two days?"@
`"-----Hm."@
` …… I knew it.@
` Since I left the house for two days, there's no excuse.@
` Time to honestly tell her all about Arcueid and these past two days.\

`"About that, Akiha."@
`"Yes, what is it, Nii-san?"@
`"These past two days, I was hunting a vampire.@ You know about the recent killings, right?@ They were the work of a vampire, so I helped the 'good vampire' I met recently, and I fought with the 'bad vampire'."@

` ----Like that, I explain concisely.\

`"Wha------"@
` Akiha is taken completely by surprise.@
` …… Well, I guess it is a natural reaction.@
` In her head, she's probably thinking I'm making a fool of her, and anytime in the next instant,
