`"Nnn-----"@
` Stressed from dinner, I loosen my shoulders.@
` I stretch out as far as I can, and then collapse onto the bed.@
`"Man, even dinner is hard work."@
` Well, it's not like the knife and fork are really heavy.@ It's just that Akiha's gaze is really severe.\

`"Are you there, Shiki-sama?"@
` I can hear Hisui's voice along with a knock at the door.@
`"Yeah, I'm here.@ Come in."@
`"Excuse me."@
` Hisui enters with a bow.\

`"I have come to make the bed.@ You may not enjoy watching it, so would you mind relaxing in the sitting room for a while?"@
`"No, I don't mind watching.@ I'll just behave myself in the corner, so just go ahead and do your job without minding me."@
` Bouncing up from the bed, I move into a corner.@
`"……"@
` Hisui looks like she wants to say something, but thinks better of it and silently begins to make the bed.\

`"---Hisui."@
`"Yes?@ What is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Oh, you can keep making the bed.@ There's no need for you to stand up so straight."@
`"……"@
` Hisui doesn't answer.@
` It seems like she's had a servant's education drummed into her.\

`"Please, just talk to me while you work.@ I'm beginning to feel bad because it seems like I'm interfering with your work."@
`"If you say so, Shiki-sama, then I will comply."@

` Hisui silently returns to making the bed.\

`"Uh… is it true that the curfew here is seven?"@

`"Eh---Oh, yes.@
` The main gate is locked at seven, and all the entrances to the mansion are to be locked at eight.@
` It is also a rule that one must try not to go walking around in the mansion after ten."\

`"Not even walking around in the mansion?@ …… Well, I've got no complaint with that, but isn't that kind of harsh?@ Akiha and I aren't children, so I don't think you have to go that far."@
`"…… Indeed.@ It is a rule, however, so please abide by it.@ You are aware of the recent disturbances at night, are you not, Shiki-sama?"@
br
` …… Yeah, that vampire thing Arihiko was talking about.@
` Well, as long as something like that is happening, I guess it's better to be safe than sorry.\

`"Do you have any other questions?@
` Hisui finishes spreading the sheets, and turns around to face me.@
`"Eh… Let's see---"@
` I have all sorts of questions, but I know nothing about Hisui and Kohaku-san.\

`"Do you mind if I ask an off-topic question?"@
`"Yes, what is it?"@
`"I'd like to know what kind of work you and Kohaku-san do around here."@
`"I am here to serve your needs and my sister Kohaku is to serve the Lady Akiha-sama.@
` In our spare time, we do the maintenance chores around the mansion.@ Is there anything more you would like to know?"@
`"…… To serve… So that's what it is after all."\

` My shoulders suddenly feel heavier.@
` It seemed completely natural to Akiha when she said it, but I'm nothing more than a normal high school student.@
` I have no interest in having a girl close to my age serving me, at least for now.\

`"…… By serving me, you mean you're a personal servant?"@
`"Yes.@ Please do not hesitate to ask anything of me."@
`"…… Well, I get it.@ Going by how Akiha was talking about you, it doesn't seem like I can dismiss you, so I'll just obediently let you serve me…"@
`"Is there anything in particular you would like?"@
`"Nothing in particular, but could you stop calling me 'Shiki-sama'?@ To be honest, I get chills down my back when I hear it."\

`"But Shiki-sama, you are my master."@
`"That's what I'm saying I hate.@ I've been living a normal life up until yesterday.@ I have no desire to start living a life where a girl my age addresses me with '-sama'."@
`"I see." Hisui's response was less than enthusiastic.\

`"Just call me Shiki, and in exchange, I'll call you Hisui.@ Let's do away with the formalities and be more casual with each other."@
` Still expressionless, Hisui lowers her eyebrows as if she's being troubled.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"But, you are my employer."@
`"It's not like I'm hiring you.@ You're the one doing the things I can't, so you're the great one."@
`"I see." Hisui gives another unenthusiastic reply.@
` …… It looks like I won't be able to talk her into it in just one day.\

`"---Anyhow, that's how it is.@ Don't be so formal towards me.@ I'll be grateful if you'd tell that to your sister Kohaku-san, too."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Very well, as you say, Shiki-sama."@
` Expressionless, Hisui bows her head.@
br
` She completely failed to understand.@
br
`"I will be leaving now.@ Please rest now for tonight."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_fst
` Bowing, Hisui puts her hand on the doorknob.\

br
` ---Oh, I forgot to ask something.@
br
`"Ah, hold on for a second."@
` Running towards the door, I put my hand on Hisui's shoulder before she leaves.@

` In an instant---Hisui's arm pushes away my arm with incredible momentum.\

` With a 'whack!', she slaps my hand away and leaps back.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t10.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Eh---?"@
` It's so sudden, that's the only thing I can say.@
` Hisui is expressionless, but she glares at me fiercely.\

`"Eh… Did I just do something wrong?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t28.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Ah…"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t26.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"…… I am very sorry…"@
` Hisui's voice sounds very nervous.@
`"…… I am not used to being touched.@ Please forgive me."@
` Hisui's shoulders are faintly trembling.@
` I feel like I just did something really terrible.\

`"Ah… Yeah, I'm sorry."@
` I apologize without thinking.@
` I don't understand why myself.@ I just feel sorry for Hisui and I lower my head.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"------"@
` Hisui says nothing.@
` I get the feeling her stare is calm again.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---You have nothing to apologize for, Shiki-sama.@ I am the one to blame."@
`"No, well, maybe, but I just…"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` I scratch my head.@
` Hisui stares at me, pausing only to blink for a second.@
`"Um… What was it you wanted to ask me, Shiki-sama?"@
` That's right.@
` I stopped Hisui because I wanted to ask her something.\

`"Oh, I wanted to ask about Akiha.@ Doesn't she go to a boarding school?"@
`"That was only during middle school, Shiki-sama.@ From this year onwards, Akiha-sama has special permission to attend school from home."@
`"Eh… You mean she goes to school from here?"@
`"Yes, but it is uncommon for her to come home before dusk like today.@ Akiha-sama has practice up until dinner, so she is always home before seven.\

`"Practice?---Practice what?"@
`"Today is Thursday, so she would have had violin practice."@
`"----Eh?"@
`"Usually, she is able to return before dinner on weekdays, so if you have anything to say to Akiha-sama, please let Nee-san know after dinner."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_fst
` Hisui bows to say goodbye, and leaves the room.\


`"Violin practice…"@
` What on earth is that?@
` She's not some upper-class lady or anything, so why should she have to do something as bothersome as---
br
`"…… Oh wait, she is an upper-class lady."@
br
` Yes.@ Come to think of it, my sister, Tohno Akiha, is a natural born upper-class lady.\

` In my memories, she was always the obedient, ever-uneasy sister constantly following me around.@
` As a child, she was always quiet, never having even the courage to express her own desires.@ She was a frail girl who would always live in fear of a scolding from our father.@
br
`"---Yeah, people really do change after eight years."@
` After eight years, I've become the me I am now.@
` Akiha has become the person she is right now, too.\

` ---Eight years is a long time.@
` It's half of our lives up until now.@
` I was absent from this mansion during that vital period where a child becomes an adult.@
br
`"…… I'm sorry, Akiha."@
` I think things would have been better if I had been with her during those eight years.@
` I unknowingly mumble an apology.\
