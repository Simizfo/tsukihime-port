` ----The night has just begun.@
` No, to be more exact, if Arcueid would be walking around, it would most likely be during the night rather than during the day.@
br
`"…… I guess it would be more efficient to search around town."@
` …… I don't want to think about it, but most of the victims are usually found in alleys.@
` If I want to find Arcueid----if I want to find the vampire killer who's continuing to murder, then I have to stick to searching the streets.\

`"----Damn it.@ What am I doing!?"@
` Not understanding my own feelings, I curse and start to run around aimlessly.\

` ------*sigh*@
` I sit down on the guard rail.@
` It's been several hours already.@
` I looked around aimlessly, and I didn't even catch a single glimpse of Arcueid.\

`"………… Damn it."@
` It's so, frustrating.@
` Of course, I knew it isn't easy to just randomly find someone in town, but I still felt optimistic I would find her.@
br
`"Where did she go……?"@
` …… Why?@
` I just wanted to ask her about the serial killings, but once I find out I can't see her, I----\

`"Ah, stop.@ Stop.@ I should just stop."@
` I stand up from the guardrail and start walking.@
` It'll be midnight soon.@ Searching for Arcueid any longer really is just useless.@
`"…………"@
` But, if I've gone this far, I can do just a little more.@
` There's one last place I need to check.@ If she's not there, then I'll go back to the mansion.\

` …… The deserted park.@
` I arrive at the place where I cooperated with Arcueid and defeated Nrvnqsr.@
` Having only looked in town, I've yet to search here.@
`"…… Well, not that I'll find anything……"@
` Grumbling to myself, I enter the park.\

` Midnight.@
` As expected, there's no one here this late at night.@ With this much silence, it rather feels refreshing.\

`"…… That's right.@ It's not like I can conveniently find her."@
` I breathe out a sigh and slump my shoulders.@
`"…… How stupid.@ Why am I so disappointed?"@
` I don't understand it myself.@
` Just, once more----I think maybe I wanted to see her smile.\

`"Ah, there you are.@ Good evening, Shiki."@
br
` …… Yeah, just like this.@ Her face that's so cheerful and carefree you can't believe it belongs to a vampire----
br
`"A,      Arcueid----!?"@
` Without even thinking, I grab both of her shoulders.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Eh----?"@
` Arcueid flinches in surprise.\
` Arcueid's shoulders are indeed real, and I quickly pull my arms back.@

`"Y, you, why----"@
` Even though the one I've been searching for so long is right before me, I can't do anything but stumble over my words.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Why?@ That's odd.@ I was looking for you, so I don't think it's coincidence we met here."@
`"Eh----You, were looking for me?@ Why?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Why?@ ----Oh, no reason."@
` She says straight out that she has no reason to be looking for me.\

`"………………"@
` …… I forgot.@ She really is kind of like a cat this way.@
`"…… Well, I guess it works out.@ To be honest, I wanted to see you too.@ So meeting here, um----"@
` I was about to say it makes me really happy, but I frantically choke those words off.\

`"----Anyway, I want to have a serious talk.@ I want to talk about it somewhere else since I feel uneasy here, so is that okay?"@
`"Sure----but talk about what?"@
`"You'll see.@ …… Let's go more to the back of the park."@
` Telling her to come on, I start walking.@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid
` Tilting her head in curiosity, she follows me obediently.\
