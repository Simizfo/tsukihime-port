` …… Maybe it really is her first time having someone treat her like this.@

`"Mm---you're sensitive here……?"@
` I whisper to her from behind.@
`"…………………………"@
` With her mouth closed, she just shakes her head back and forth.@
` She answers one way, but her body responds another.\

` Not in satisfaction---but in anticipation.\

`"…… Kohaku.@ You want this, right?"@

` She speaks softly, as if she doesn't want to be heard.@
` Her kimono drapes to the side.@

` …… Hot.@
` My fingers sink into her tender flesh.@
` Just touching them sets my brain afire.\

`"…… Mm…… Shiki-sa… n…… What… are you… doing?"@
` That's an odd question.@

`"…… I don't…… believe it…… Shiki-san, I---"@

` My teasing fingertips sense the rising heat of her body.@

` And then---I take my thumb and forefinger and squeeze a delicate pink nipple.\

`"Ah, ahhh…………!!"@
` Her body jolts.@
` My fingers move harder.@
` Sensing her enjoyment, they twist even harder, and I use my nails this time.@
`"…… Mm, haa……… oh…… ah---"@

` I didn't really think it, but---
`"Is this the first time you've felt this good……?"@
`"Ah………………"@

` Still looking down in embarrassment, she gives a slight nod.\

`"…… I'm sorry.@ I… feel strange.@ I know I should be servicing you, but---just your touch, makes my head spin----"@
` She breathes out again.@
` As if trying to force out all the heat in her body, she takes another breath.\

`"Um…… Shiki-san, you're not… going to take off your clothes?"@
` …… What she says is only natural.@
` But being naked now would expose that which has been yearning for quite some time.@
`"Soon.@ Here, come to the bed."@
` Walking to the bed, I lay down on my back.@
` I undo my zipper and my swollen manhood immediately springs out.\

`"----------"@

` She's probably surprised to see it erect so quickly.@
`"Hey, Kohaku.@ I need to pay you back, so come here."@
` I invite her over, still pointing at her without my finger.@
`"……………… Yes."@
` She gets on the bed while breathing rapidly.@
` It's just like before.@

` Her delicious, white thighs.@
` And between them, her swollen lips.@
` I feel like sweet honey would pour from these passionate petals if coaxed by my tongue.@
` The sensuous curves of her bottom add another dimension of captivation in addition to her bewitching thighs.\

`"Ah…………… Shiki… san-----"@
` Kohaku's voice quivers.@
` She must be embarrassed at having herself so open to me.@
` Drip.@ A drop of her juice splashes onto my forehead.\

`"…… Mm…… Kohaku, you're really getting into this."@

` I enter only the slightest bit, as if only to taste her dewing liquids.\

`"Huah------oh, nnaah…………………!"@

` Her hips jerk upwards.@
` Pushing down to prevent her escape, this time I caress the outside surface.@
` My tongue rolls up and down.@

` She licks only at my very tip.@

`"Ko… haku----it feels… so good."@
` I resume.@
` My breathing increases in depth as her wetness rains down on me.@
`"Mm…………!@ …… Haa…… ah, ha…… Shiki-san, M…… more……"@
` Faintly whispering, she grabs me with both hands.@
` She gently pulls my slippery pole.@
` She starts to caress me with her tongue once more.\

`"Ha------kkk……………!"@
` This time, she doesn't hold back.@
` Completely different than before, she doesn't use any special technique.@ She only follows the instinctual urges of her body.@
` This sets my body on fire---far more than any special technique.\

`"Ah…… nnn…… aah…… oh----"@
` Her breathing continues its ragged procession.@
` Does she enjoy caressing me that much?@ Her sweet juices continue to flow unhindered from her passionate tunnel.\

`"Mm-----, haaa."@
` I drink every last drop of that sensuous nectar.@
` …… There's a reason for this.@
` Kohaku, who is caressing me.@
` Kohaku, who is filling me with pleasure.@
` I don't want to miss a single drop of anything coming from her.@
` That's why I gather it all… with my tongue… with my hand.\

` The sound of meeting flesh echoes through the room.@
` Not just the rubbing of our passionate places, but our whole bodies melting together.@
br
` Her breasts glide across my stomach.@
` Her arms touching my sides, her legs resting by my head and shoulders.\

` Sliding, sliding, sliding.@
br
` Rubbing.@ Sweat, her wetness, my semen, our bodies.@
` Kohaku gasps continually---her wildness spreads to me.\

`"-----I can't, take this."@
` Feeling my limit near, I look down.@
` Kohaku traces her fingers along my shaft and licks them clean with her red tongue.@
br
` ---I wish this could go on forever, but I know it can't last.@
` The swelling in my loins becomes a burning cyclone.\

`"----Kohaku, lie down."@
` I tell her gently.@
`"…… Eh…… lie down……?"@
` She doesn't seem to understand but moves to do as I said.\

` She lies down flat on her back.@
` Propping myself above her in perfect symmetry, I admire the view before me.\

` No, even if you didn't become the killer, you just had to walk the streets at night.@
