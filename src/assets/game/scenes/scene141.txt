`"Huh?"@
` What does she mean by last night?@
` I don't understand what she's talking about.@
` After all, I'm the idiot who mistook Arcueid's words and made such a stupid mistake, so of course I don't understand what she is saying, and---huh?@

`"Um, it's like a familiar that lets you see a dream about what you desire the most.@ You're a male, so I sent you a succubus.@ Wasn't it a good dream?"@

` ---Crap.@
` If I stayed quiet this conversation would have been over, but since I reacted so strongly---\

`"Hmm.@ If it wasn't your sister, then was it the maids at the mansion?"@

`"It doesn't concern you, so leave me alone."@

` But Arcueid keeps saying "Come on, come on," over and over.\

` She's as mischievous as last night's dream.\

` I bury my face in my hands.@

` ---I can't, God.@
` This is my limit.@

`"…… You."@
` I hesitatingly let it out in a quiet voice.\


`"---Eh?@ What about me?"@
`"Don't make me say it again.@ I'm saying that it was you who came!"@

` Arcueid's eyes widen in surprise.@

`"…………"@

`"…………"@
` Maybe I did say too much.@
` No matter what the results were or the methods used, she really thanked me with good intentions.@ I start to feel intense regret and think that maybe I should have just accepted her gift happily.\
