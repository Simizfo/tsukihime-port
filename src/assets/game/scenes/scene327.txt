`"Very well.@ What is it, Nii-san?"@
`"What is it!?@ Why have you transferred to this school?@ What possible reason could you have for transferring to a second-rate elevator school!?"\

`"So you say, Nii-san.@ But I can go to school wherever I choose; I do not need to explain myself to you."@
`"…… Don't be stupid.@ I'm your brother!@ I can't just overlook things that are against your best interests.@
` Frankly, I can't see any benefit in you transferring to this school.@ Since our old man isn't around anymore, it's my responsibility to look out for you…!"\

`"…… What?@ It's not fair to say things like that at times like these."@
`"'Not fair' is my line.@ What were you thinking, transferring without even telling me?@
` I won't accept this transfer until I hear a good reason!"@

`"Ah----"@
`"If I'm not satisfied with the reason, I'll send you right back to your own school.@ So, tell me, Akiha.@ Why did you change schools?"@

` Akiha falls silent and looks down.@
` A very brief moment later, she raises a brave face.\

` -------Eh?@

`"…… Ha, hang on.@ What do you mean, worried about me…?"@
` What sort of reason is that for transferring?\

`"Well, looking at your unruly behavior recently, I decided that in order to prevent you from disgracing the Tohno name, I would have to keep a close eye on you."@
` Akiha explains clearly.@
`"Erk----"@
` When she says "unruly behavior", I can't help but nod.@
` It's true; my everyday life since coming here has surely been an annoyance to Akiha and the others.\

`"Bu, but, transferring is still a bit much, isn't it?@ What about your friends?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t05a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's none of your concern, Nii-san.@ If you feel even a little bad for me, then all you have to do is change your way of thinking from now on."@
` Akiha turns sharply away.@
` …… Well, this is just the way she is.\

`"…… Alright, do as you please.@ But one day, you'll regret it."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's fine.@ I wasn't thinking of having you worry over me, Nii-san."@
` With a sound of exasperation, Akiha starts to sulk.\
