` ----And then,
` I embrace Akiha's body from the front.\

` ---There's no way I could kill her.@
br
`"…… I want you to live."@
` Akiha tilts her head questioningly.@
`"No matter what you become---I still want you to live, Akiha."@
` My tears cannot be stopped.@
` Akiha hugs back joyfully---and bites on my neck.\

`"-----!!"@
` It hurts.@
` But it is not an act to suck my blood.@
` It is just a primitive act to bite me.\

`"A-Akiha."@
` Akiha just frantically bites my neck.@
` She tears off the meat and my bones are being chipped away.@
` Akiha has no intelligence.@
` She does not know who is holding her, or the meaning of an embrace.@
br
` Akiha is no different from a beast in human form.@
` But still----\

`"---Still…… I want you to live."@
br
` …… Is it wrong to wish such a thing?@
` Is it a crime to wish for her to stay alive even though she goes around killing people?@
` Even if Akiha says she cannot endure such a thing, I want her to endure past it.\

` But.@
` That's---just a selfish wish.\

`"----But, we made a promise."@
` Akiha does not let go.@
` Still holding on to her, I place my knife on Akiha's "line".\

br
` ---If someone is going to kill you eventually, then…
br
`"I won't let anyone hurt you."@
br
` ----The knife, without a sound,
`   and probably without pain,
br
`"Since I am the only one for you."@
br
` ----Gently ends Akiha's life.\

` The autumn leaves fall.@
` Akiha lies on the red ground.@
` The hair scattered on the ground is black.@ It vividly undulates on the red leaves.@
` Her face is peaceful, as if happily dreaming.\

`"----------"@
` One event has ended.@
` When I was a child.@
` The happiness when we met here and ran around this courtyard.@
` The brightness of the stars we watched together.@
br
` Just a few days ago.@
` Everything we talked about here.\

br
br
` ----Nii-san, I am just happy that you have come back.@
` …… I just want you to keep that in mind.\

` At some point, I started staring at the moon.@
` …… My body is cold.@
` My mind feels dizzy, like I'm about to go to sleep.\

` …… I'm sleepy.@
` I feel like if I slept right now, I could dream that this was all a dream.@
br
` But that's just a dream and someday, I would have to wake up.@
` It feels like even I am just part of this dream.@
br
` Or was everything an ephemeral dream from the start?@
` If so, please…
` Let me sleep on and never wake me up.\

`"---------Ha, ha."@
br
` In the sky, the blue, blue, glass moon.@
` The tall curtain of trees and the applause of showering crimson leaves.@
br
`"Haha, ha------"@
br
` I'm sad, yet all that comes forth is laughter.\

` The night is deep.@
` There is a serene silence around me, which hits my eardrums like thunderous applause.@
` My view distorts and narrows.@
` …… It seems to be time to lower the curtain.@
` The curtain of trees turns round and round.@
br
` As if
` everything in this circus
` was artificial.\
