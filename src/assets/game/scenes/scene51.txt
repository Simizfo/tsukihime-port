` The howling continues.@
` There's no way I can sleep like this.@
` …… I can't sleep, but that's just normal.@
br
`"…… I'm sleepy, so I'll pass."@
` Pulling the sheets over me, I stretch out on the bed.@
` I can just think of the howling as the sound of something mundane, like cars driving by on the street.\

` *sigh*@
` Today's been a very long day.@
` I'm mentally tired from eating dinner in this unfamiliar mansion and my conversations with Akiha and everyone else.@
` After all that, the howling is just background noise.@
` I close my eyes and gently fall asleep.\

br
` ---I have a nostalgic dream.@
br
` The end of summer eight years ago.@
` After I was injured, was taken to that hospital where no one ever visited, and met Sensei.@
` Upon returning to the mansion, I heard from my old man that I would be taken in by a family I had never heard of.@
br
` Everything happened so fast.@
` Right after the day I left the hospital, I ended up going to the Arima household.\

` There was not a single cloud in the blue sky that day.@
` The start of autumn.@
` I was led away from the Tohno mansion.@
br
` But a little before that…
` That girl had come to see me, sneaking past the eyes of the adults.\

`"When you are about to leave, please come to the tree in the rear courtyard."@
` After being told that, I snuck out from under my old man's eye and out to the rear courtyard.\

` The sky was blue.@
` Below that deep blue sky that seemed to extend forever, she waited for me.@
` As far as I knew, this was the first time she had left the mansion to come outside.\

`"Take this."@
` Saying that, she undid the ribbon that bound her hair and handed it to me.@
` I guess it was her farewell gift to me, but as a child, I didn't even feel happy about it.@
br
` …… After all, what kind of a nine year old boy would feel happy about receiving a ribbon?\

`"That ribbon is my favorite, so give it back to me later, okay?"@
` But those were the words that saved me.@
br
` "Give it back," she said.@
` "Come back," is what I heard from those words.@
br
` ---Just that was good enough for me.@
` That last day, with no one to even see me off.@
` For her, who I had never even spoken to, to say that to me… it made me happy.\

` ---But I could not say, "I'll definitely return it."@
br
` As clever as I was at the time, I realized I would never be able to return to this mansion ever again.@
br
` …… Those were the only words we exchanged.@
` Something about her icy eyes was very sorrowful.@
` It was time, so I began walking towards the doorway.@
` The girl just stood there like a doll, watching me leave.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` A distant dream of what happened on one fine day.@
` Under the cloudless blue sky.\
