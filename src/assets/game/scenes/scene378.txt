` ----No time to waste.@
` I have to kill him before his wounds heal, or he will kill me.@
br
` I take a forced breath,
` and spur my tired body after SHIKI.\

` Panting-----
br
` My breath echoes through the dark forest.@
` In this darkness, the trail of blood seems to light the way.@
` There's no way I'll let SHIKI go now.@
` The question is, can my body survive long enough?\

` Breathing heavily,
` I run while wobbling side to side.@
` I feel my knife in my left hand.@
` The sensation of the knife firmly gripped by my hand is the only thing keeping me from passing out.@
br
`"Is he…… going to the courtyard?"@
br
` It looks like the trail of blood leads to the courtyard.@
` Eight years ago.@
` The place where Nanaya Shiki was killed by Tohno SHIKI.@
` …… Come to think of it, there's no better place to finish our match.\

`"-----Alright SHIKI, I'll…"@
` Kill you.@

` Everything turns red.\

`"Gu-------ugh."@
` Blood accompanies my breath out of my body.@
` Blood spews out of my heart.@
` I start to pass out and----fall to the ground.@
`"What----?"@
` I don't understand.@
` I just feel pain and burning everywhere.\

`"-----What the…"@
` I look at my back.@
` There I see numerous swords stuck like wings.@
` They stick through me and up towards the sky.@
` That means…
` This wound is fatal.@
`"Why-----?"@
` I don't understand.@
` It's not that these swords came flying at me.@
` They just suddenly seemed to sprout from inside me.\

` The sound of dripping blood.@
` It drips down the swords on my body.@
` The blood is not mine---
br
`"----Oh, that blood back then."@
br
` …… The blood that spilled on me when I cut SHIKI.@
` That was still on my chest.@
` …… What a stupid mistake.@
` I knew that red swords were made from his blood---so having his blood on me is like asking him to stab me to death any time he pleases.\

`"------Ah."@
` I start to fade.@
` I look up at the sky in my own sea of blood.@
br
` The far away moon.@
` Dark night, tall trees.@
` I am facing the same meaningless death as once before.\
