` Yumizuka whispers joyfully.\

`"What are---you talking about… Yumizu… ka---"@
`"I'm saying that I'm making both of us the same, Shiki-kun.@ Sucking people's blood instead of eating normal food, nocturnal, unable to walk under the sun.@ You're going to be a different creature."@
br
` …… What is, that.@
` Ridiculous, that's just like--\

`"Yeah, like a vampire.@ I didn't really understand how I became this way either.@
` Two nights ago, I went out to check the rumor that you were walking around in the shopping district every night, and then when I came to I was lying down in that back alley.@
` Back then, I thought it was just cold, dark, and painful."\

`"But it's strange, after a while, after my body has changed completely, I understood a lot of things.@
` My body hurts because it's being destroyed very fast, and the sunlight acts like a catalyst for that.@ And if I want to stop the destruction, I need the genetic information of the same type of living organism as myself."\

`"Yeah, I didn't understand the logic that well, but it was plain enough what I had to do.@
` I was cold, and it was lonely by myself.@ I didn't want to disappear, so I just grabbed a random person and sucked his blood.@
` And you know what?@ It was really delicious!@ The pain went away and I thought I could do anything.\

`"But, it was so nice that before I realized it, it was all gone.@
` The man was all shriveled up, like a mummy, and I felt really bad.@ I thought to myself that I was turning into a monster, both in mind and body.@
` ---But, I had to do it in order to live.@
` Like I said, I didn't kill them because I hated them.@ I suck blood the same way you people eat animals.@ So I decided not to think about it too deeply."\

`"Wha---"@
` What… is this?@
` Is it okay to kill other people in order to live?@
` That… I…\

`"But, it seems I've become a proper vampire.@
` Tonight's meal was quite fun.@ Until now, I've been sucking blood since I was cold and in pain, but now that I'm getting the hang of sucking blood, it's becoming more interesting.@
` You understand, don't you Shiki-kun?@ You are a much better killer than I am."@
`"Wha---"@
` What…
` What are you talking about, Yumizuka.\

`"Didn't I say it before?@ I was always watching you, so I know your gentle side and your scary side.@
` I never talked to you because I didn't understand your scary side."\

`"But I understand now.@ You're the same as me.@
` Hey Shiki-kun.@ Even you were thinking you wanted to kill someone, without love or hate having anything to do with it."@
`"Don't---be ridiculous."@
` I've never even once thought that.\

`"I'm not being ridiculous!@ I never understood the fragile air about you, but now my body has changed, and I can understand……!@
` Shiki-kun, just you being there is flirting with death.@ That's the kind of person you are.@ Like me, someone who has to kill people.@
` Your need to kill others is the same as the need to breathe, right?"\

`"You know, I was really happy yesterday.@ It was the first time I was happy after becoming this way.@ Because I finally understood you, Shiki-kun.@ I never really knew you before.@
` Shiki-kun, you're the same, right?@ You see someone, and for no reason, your heart throbs, and your throat goes dry.@
` Seeing red blood, you enter a stupor like you were drunk from alcohol, right?@
` Stealing the life of others, extinguishing the life of others, isn't it so exciting?@ So fun!"@
