` The sun sets.@
` Even after running everywhere in town, there's no sign of Yumizuka Satsuki anywhere.@
br
`"………… Gah."@
` I bite my lip angrily.@
` …… But it's not anger over not finding her.\

` Two days ago.@
` I'm mad at myself for promising such a thing in the first place.@
br
` --Help me when I'm in a pinch, okay?@
br
` Yumizuka said that, and I answered lightheartedly.@
` I would help, as much as I could.@
` …… Such an irresponsible answer.@
` There's really nothing I can do.@
` She said it hurt.@
` I can't even find Yumizuka, painfully suffering in the cold darkness.\

`"---"@
` The sun is setting.@
` …… I don't want to admit it, but maybe I can only find Yumizuka after nightfall.@
`"…… I told Hisui I'd be back in the evening."@
` Perhaps it's too early.@
` I'll go back to the mansion and calmly think this through.\
