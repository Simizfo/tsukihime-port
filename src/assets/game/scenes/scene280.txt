` Besides, I'm not in the best health right now, so if I don't eat I'll really collapse.@
`"Guess I'll go to the cafeteria."@
` Thinking aloud, I get up from my desk.\

` The big rush must be over because there isn't a line.@
` The tables are mostly full of students already eating.@

` …… I see someone who looks like Senpai.\

`"----Haha."@
` I laugh loudly.@
` Mistaking someone for Ciel-senpai because there's a small resemblance… I truly am beat.\

` I know I'm beat, but I can't take my eyes away from this person that looks like her.@
` This person that looks like her sits at the table slurping up udon.@
` It's curry udon too.@
` Even her food resembles what Senpai would eat.@
br
`"------Ah."@
br
` Actually, it is Senpai.\

`"-------"@

` Senpai looks up at me, then glances away quickly.@
` She's clearly avoiding me.@
` But, that doesn't matter.\

`"Senpai, why are you here……!"@
` I blurt that out because I can't even think of anything else to say.@

`"Why am I here?@ I'm a student here, you know.@ If I don't eat during lunchtime, I'll collapse."@
`"No, that's not what I mean, but---"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` I don't know what to say.@ My brain just stopped functioning.@
` She looks away from me as if she wants to complain.\

`"I thought it was strange for you to be here.@ Just yesterday, you said farewell, so I thought I would never see you again---"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes, because it was getting late.@ Students should go back home at that time, yes?"@
` Simply.@
` With a straight face, she says this outrageous punch line.\

`"Wha---"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Or, Tohno-kun, are you saying people like me shouldn't come to school?"@
` Her eyes, that were so devoid of emotion yesterday, look directly into mine.@
br
` …… A student like me?@ That's what she said.@
` I don't know if she's really a vampire or not.@
` But she healed from that fatal wound quickly, so she has to be something more than human, like Arcueid.@
` You just can't say that's human.\

` But still.@
` To me, she is a very dear person.@
` I still don't know exactly what kind of feelings I have for her.@
` But with just half a day.@ It was only half a day, but just thinking she wasn't in my world anymore made me feel like reality was nothing I should care for.@
` So---for me, she is someone I can't lose.\

`"…… Senpai, I---"@
` I'd be lying if I said all of it, but I don't care.@
` Even if she is the same as Arcueid, Senpai is still Senpai.@ That is an absolute truth I believe in.@
` Yes, I should say those words I couldn't say last night.@
br
` However, before that…\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Fine.@ I cannot help it if you hate me, Tohno-kun.@ But this is my daily life, so no matter what you say, I decided to do as I please."@
br
` She speaks directly.@
` "You don't have any complaints, right?" Senpai says and stares at me.\

`"………… Huh?"@
` Of course, no complaints here.@
`  I feel like such an idiot worrying about it so much.@ The strength drains from my body.@
` But more than that, I can't help but feel really happy.@
`"…… Yeah, of course I don't have any complaints.@ Because up until now, I was ignoring all your warnings and doing as I pleased too, Senpai."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"That is acceptable.@ Then, let's shake hands."@
` She sticks out her hand.@
` I don't know what she's thinking, but I take her outstretched hand.@
br
` Senpai shakes it up and down.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes, then this is a sign that we have made peace.@ Let's stay this way, okay Tohno-kun?"@
` She flashes a full, truly happy smile.@
cl c,%type_lshutter_slw
` With that, she stands up, taking her tray as she walks away.@
br
` …… I don't know where, but she seems to be heading somewhere.\

`"Ah----"@
` After putting her dishes in their place, she exits the cafeteria.@
` …… That's fine.@
` I'm happy that she is still here at school, and that we've made up but---can I let things go about Arcueid, and that vampire we're hunting?@
