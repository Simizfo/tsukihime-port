`"------------"@
` I won't fall for that trick.@
` My body stops working properly when I listen to him.@
` If there is a way to turn back Akiha, I'll find it myself.@
` No way---no way will SHIKI, the one who turned Akiha that way, tell me.\

`"----Huh!@ I guess you won't fall for it.@ Alright then.@ It's all about killing each other from now on.@
` Let's see who's the better killer."@
` SHIKI laughs, still down on the ground.@
`"------------"@
` I don't answer and instead walk straight to him.@
` About ten more meters to go.@
` I will be able to jump at him within a few seconds.\

`"…… Heh.@ Don't tell me you think you're good just because you cut one of my arms off, Shiki."@
`"--------"@
br
` One meter.\

`"I'll teach you one last thing.@
` You know everyone in the Tohno family has different powers, right?@ I guess Akiha's good at taking heat from her surroundings.@ Well, it's kind of like that, influencing the outside world, like an interference ability."@
`"--------"@
br
` Two meters.\

`"It seems the ability to interfere with the outside world has been scarce even in the Tohno family.@ You can say that Akiha's ability is rare.@ Since she has such large potential, it doesn't wake up easily.@ Any time I try to wake it up, it's like throwing a rock into the ocean.@
` The best way to use her full ability is to have someone take over her mind and control her."@
`"--------"@
br
` Three meters.\

`"Well, let's put Akiha off to the side.@ It's more important to talk about me right now."@
`"--------"@
br
` Four meters.\

`"Shiki, I'm like the old man; I have no method to interfere with the outside world.@ The vampire ability isn't my original ability.@ This is more like a bonus that I got later.@ My real ability is 'immortality'."@
`"--------"@
br
` Five meters.\

`"Well, there are limits to my immortality, since I can't heal my own wounds.@ Isn't it weird that this ability is called immortality?@
` But it's true that dying is hard for me.@ My body changes its context so that it can survive whatever state it is in at that moment.@
` Humans die when they lose a large portion of their body, right?@ That's because humans need a 'Human shape' with all the necessary parts to live as a human.@ If they can't find a substitute for their lost part, they die.@ Well, it might be more correct to say they cannot continue to live."@
`"--------"@
br
` Six meters.\

`"But in my case, it's the opposite.@
` I don't supplement my lost parts.@ Instead, I continue to live even if I lose an arm or all my blood.@ My body changes its internal organs so that I can live without the parts I lost.@
` See, can't you say that this is 'immortality'?@ I would probably live even if my head only remained.@ …… Well, there's no way I'd want to be like that."\

`"--------"@
` Seven meters.@
` …… One more step.@
` Then, I am within reach----\


`"…… You're about to kill me, huh?@
` Well, what I want to say is this.@ I have the ability not to influence the outside world, but rather my inner body.@
` Do you get it?@ Even if it seems like a useless part of your body to you, for me------"@
`"--------"@
br
` This is it.@
` Now, I'll-----\

` Suddenly, from my ankles to my head…

` You need to pay more attention.@ There's no way I would scatter this much blood for no reason."@

` How stupid of me.@
` I followed his trail of blood,

`"I don't have the ability like you or Akiha to hurt others directly, so I have to rely on little tricks like these.@
` But if this 'someone' in my head becomes clearer, I might be able to use his ability as a vampire."\
