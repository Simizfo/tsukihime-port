` I don't think I would even be able to look at Akiha if I went into the sitting room now.@ I don't want to look suspicious.@ It would be better if I stay in my room until Akiha leaves.\

` Phew.@ I let out a deep sigh.@
` I feel bad for Akiha, but I should worry about my own troubles for now.\

` Yesterday's dream.@
` Even though I knew I was asleep, I seemed to have wandered out at night.@
` With my hands full of this problem, I don't have the energy to act out my "usual self".@
`"………… Shit."@

` Suddenly, Kohaku-san comes out of the kitchen, scolding me.\

`"Oh…… good morning, Kohaku-san."@
`"It's not 'good morning'!@ What time do you think it is, Shiki-san!!"@
` Kohaku-san might be really mad, as she unleashes quite the scary attitude.@
`"…… I'm sorry.@ I couldn't wake up this morning so I decided it didn't matter if I'm late for school or not."@
`"Geez, I'm not talking about school!!@ I'm asking you why you didn't show up and talk to Akiha-sama for just a little while!!"@
` Kohaku-san draws her eyebrows together.@
`"Well…… Um, I kinda felt like it was hard for me to face Akiha this morning, um-----"\

`"Felt like it!?@ Akiha-sama was waiting for you all this time!!@ But you don't say a word to her and show up after she leaves?@ That's terrible!"@
`"…… Ugh."@
` …… I can't counter that.@
` It's because I do feel guilty for avoiding Akiha.@
`"…… I understand.@ But it's not like I dislike Akiha.@ But this morning… I really didn't feel like I could talk to her."\

`"No, you do not understand anything!@ You don't know how much Akiha-sama was looking forward to this while waiting for you up until now."@
`"What---Waiting for me, you mean this morning?"@
`"No.@ Akiha-sama told me not to tell you, but I can't bear this anymore!"@

` To begin with, Akiha-sama would not have made it to school unless she left here at six.@ Nevertheless, she overlooked that because she was looking forward to eating breakfast with you."@
`"…… Looking forward to?@ Why?@ She complains every time she sees me."@
`"Because Akiha-sama isn't honest.@ If you ever woke up on time, I do not think she would have any complaints."\

`"But all you did was sleep in and didn't eat with her even once.@ But Akiha-sama told me just seeing your face in the morning is good enough, and she never told us to go wake you up."@
