`"Guh---ffpt."@

` Stomach acid drips over my lips.@

` Mixed with the juices is something red.@
` My throat is probably bleeding because my stomach keeps trying to throw up even when there's nothing left in there.@

`"---It's all lies."@

` Yes, actually, I understand everything.@
` I lusted after her.@ Just looking at her aroused me.\
` When I cut her apart, it was so thrilling I almost ejaculated.@
` These eyes, too.@
` If I knew these "lines" could cut things apart like paper being shredded…
` I should have understood that even a person could easily be cut apart like I just did to her.@
` I had lived a normal life without even thinking about something like that.@
br
` ---If I really am the sort of dangerous person who could easily kill just about anything…
` Then I should have put out these eyes or lived a life without seeing anyone.\

` Not even such a simple promise,

`"------"@

` I killed that person.@
` That person's life up until now.@
` The people around that person,
` the future that person dreamed of,
` everything---destroyed by a stranger.@
br
` Even if I regret it, I can't be forgiven.\
` Even if I apologize, I can't be forgiven.\

`"Have I----gone insane?"@
br
` I don't know.@
` There isn't even a trace of that impulse left.@
` The thought of holding back never crossed my mind.@
` I didn't even consider trying to stop myself.\
`"Kill this girl."@
` It had seemed like the obvious thing to do, and I went through with it.\
` Then the answer is simple.@
` I must be insane.@
br
` I've probably been mad since eight years ago, when I miraculously came back to life from a fatal accident.\
