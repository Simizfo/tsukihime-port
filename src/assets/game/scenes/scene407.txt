`"…… Why… did I lock it……"@
` My thoughts start to move through a haze.@
` That, was because----

`"--------"@
` That's right.@
` I locked it so Akiha wouldn't get in.\


`"Nii-san……!@ I know you're up.@ You have to get your examination, so why did you lock the door!?"@
` Bam bam.@ She knocks harder.@
` Akiha frantically calls me from outside in a bitter voice.@
`"Please open the door already!@ You haven't had your evening IV, do you want to die!?"@
` The pounding on the door doesn't stop.@
` …… That's only natural.@
` It's not good for Akiha if I shut myself in this room like this.@
` As long as I'm doing this--Akiha will not be able to kill me.\

`"Nii-san……!?@ Hey, are you listening to me, Nii-san……!?"@
` Bam, Bam.@
` …… I don't really mind the knocking, but I cannot stand having to listen to her voice.@
br
`"Shut--up…………!!"@
br
`"Eh------?"@
` I hear her gasp from the other side of the door.\


`"Shut… up?@ …… Nii-san, I am only worrying about you---"@
`"…… I don't care.@ I'm not coming out.@ If you're really worried about me, then just go away."@
`"Wha--"@
`"Do you get it?@ I'm not ever coming out.@ I won't--let you--kill me……!"@
` Thud.@ I hit the door.@
` …… The other side of the door becomes a frozen silence.\

` --And after that…

`"…… Nii-san, just what do you mean?@ Who told you I would kill you?"@
`"…… Just go away……!@ I'm not a killer, I'm still sane……!"@
`"I can't believe it----Nii-san, you are already pulled in this much?"@
` Her words are filled with surprise.@
` I sense her step back from the door.\


`"…… I understand.@ Nii-san, you are exhausted right now, so I will come back and see you later."@
`"--Shut up!@ I won't let you or anyone else in this room……!"@
`"…… Nii-san.@ I will listen to your words today, but tomorrow, I will make you listen to me.@
` Leaving you by yourself for one day is dangerous enough; I simply cannot leave you alone for two days, otherwise you will surely die.@ Please wait for just one more day, Nii-san."@
` I hear her footsteps recede.\

` *pant*…… *pant*…… *pant*
` I can hardly breathe.@ Just like Akiha said, I will surely die at this rate.@
` *pant*…… *pant*…… *pant*
` But, it's still better than Akiha killing me.@
br
` ----I keep the door locked.@
br
` I lean against the wall and keep my eyes open so I won't fall asleep.\
