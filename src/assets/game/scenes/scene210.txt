`"Huh…?@ This is a Japanese-style room, isn't it?"@

`"That's right.@ It's very relaxing since no one else is here."@
`"Well, that's true, but… isn't this place locked, Senpai?"@
`"Yes.@ It's usually only open to members of the tea ceremony club, so normal students can't get in."@
` Saying so, she takes a key out of her pocket.\

`"Oh.@ Are you in the tea ceremony club, Senpai?"@

`"As I said earlier, I'm the only member of the tea club.@ Thanks to that, I can use this place freely during lunchtime and after class.@ Here."@
` Laughing, Senpai lays out cushions.@
`"I'll make some tea now, so please wait right there, Tohno-kun."@
cl a,%type_lshutter_fst
` …… Senpai heads towards the sink to prepare the tea.@
` There's no point in standing up, so I do as I am told and sit down on the cushion.\

`"………"@
` Perhaps it was the magic of the Japanese-style room.@
` That chaotic maelstrom that had been raging in my chest calms down, and now I can finally begin to think calmly about what has happened with Yumizuka.\
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Thanks for waiting.@ Here you are.@ Now, let's have some lunch.@ Actually, I have some things to ask you, so it's just as well we're having lunch here."@
`"You have something to talk to me about?"@
` Puzzled, I drink the tea I'm offered.@
` As I'm in the Japanese-style room, my posture reflexively straightened and my mind has become tranquil.\

` …… Although I had no connection to it, the Arima family heads a tea ceremony school.@ Perhaps it was because I had been raised in that kind of environment, that I feel more at ease in a Japanese-style room than a Western-style one.@
` Senpai looks at me with a troubled expression.\

`"What's wrong, Senpai?@ You look a bit worried."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Eh?@ Ah, um, I was just a little surprised at how calm you were about all of this, Tohno-kun."@
`"Really?@ Well, my family is a strict one, so I'm used to these kinds of things.@ More importantly, Senpai, didn't you have something you wanted to talk to me about?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I do.@ The continuation of what we were talking about earlier."@
`"…… What we were talking about earlier… you mean about my family?"@
` Senpai nods to indicate a yes.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"If you don't mind, I would like to hear more about it.@ I was curious about it since we stopped halfway."@
`"…… It's not that I mind, but hearing about my family isn't very interesting.@ It'd be a waste of time."@
`"I don't mind if it's not interesting, I just want to hear about it."@
`"…… Hmm, you sure are eccentric, Senpai."@
`"Maybe I am," Senpai laughs.\

`"Alright, then.@ Let's continue from before.@ You said you moved to your home.@ What do you mean by that?"@
` Senpai asks, full of curiosity.@
` …… Well, the conversation back then must've been pretty fragmented for Senpai, since she didn't know any of the circumstances.\

`"---Let's see.@ Basically, I'm a guy who's been disinherited.@
` I was seriously injured after getting caught up in a traffic accident when I was nine years old.@
` The injuries themselves somehow healed, but after that, I easily collapsed from anemia and threw up my food.@ That's why I was entrusted to my relatives, the Arimas, while I recuperated."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Uh, so in other words, the Arimas have been your parents who raised you since you were nine, right?"\

`"That's right.@ I knew my old man hated me for some reason and that once I had been entrusted to the Arimas, I would never go back home…… Go back to the Tohno mansion, that is.@ That's why, well, I thought I'd just continue to live as a son of the Arimas forever.@
` That's what I thought, but my old man kicked the bucket recently.@ That's when they told me to return to the mansion, now that my old man is no longer there, and I finally agreed."\

` ---And that, pretty much, is my domestic situation.@
br
` I end my story like that.@
` Ciel-senpai gives a little nod silently.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… May I just ask one thing?"@
`"Mm?@ Sure, if I can answer it.@ Go ahead."@
`"…… Alright, then I'll ask.@ Did you dislike your previous family?"@
br
` My previous family---the Arimas who had raised me as my parents?@
br
` My mother and father who weren't my real parents,
` and the unfamiliar building which without a doubt was home to strangers.@
` But completely regardless of that---\

`"No, I liked them.@ They were people who didn't care that I wasn't related to them by blood.@ They were so warm to me that I felt bad about being depressed all by myself.@ And for them to love me no matter what…… I didn't think it was a bad thing."\
` ---I was loved by these people.@
br
` That's why soon, even one day sooner,
` I have to truly become family to them---\
br
` I had been telling myself those words since I was young.@
` …… Since a very, very long time ago.@
` Over and over, I swore, till I would practically pass out.\

`"…… Um, just like Arihiko said, I didn't have a single complaint about the Arima family.@
` They treated me well, and I think I responded to their affection, too.@
` Between us, even though I knew we were just playing at being family, even if it was all just an act, I didn't feel any pain."@
` No, I was happy instead.@
` In a way, I had considered the Arima parents and me to be the ideal nuclear family.\

`"---But it was no good, was it?"@
`"…… Yeah.@ Despite everything, there was a line I couldn't cross.@ 'This isn't your real family……' No matter what I did, I couldn't get those words out of my head.@
` I knew I should have been ignoring it, but I just couldn't do it.@
` I don't know if you'd call it a childhood experience, but it had already become like a curse to me.@ Somehow, no matter where I was, I felt like a stranger to my family."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` Senpai is silent.@
` Avoiding my gaze, she huddles her shoulders apologetically.\
`"See?@ It was boring after all, right?@ That's why I said it would be a waste of time."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, that's not true.@ It was a very meaningful story."@
` Saying that, Senpai begins to eat her own lunch.\

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

` I follow her example and start nibbling off the bread I had bought.@
` …… Thanks to my conversation with Senpai, my appetite has returned.@
` Despite that, I still couldn't even finish half of it.\

`"So.@ Tohno-kun, is anything troubling you right now?"@
`"Eh--why that, all of a sudden?@ I don't have any worries in particular."@
`"Hmmm.@ Then I suppose the reason you aren't eating much must be because of your health."@
` Senpai stares at me.@
` …… Somehow, her gaze feels very penetrating.@
` It feels difficult to remain silent under a gaze like that.\

`"…… I don't have any worries, but… Senpai, what do you think of the recent killings?"@
` I can't help but ask.@ The stories about my classmate who hasn't returned home won't leave my mind.\

`"Killings?@ Oh, you mean that business about the vampires?"@
`"--Yes.@ There's already been eight victims, right?@ I haven't caught the news lately, so I'm not too sure about this subject.@ Do you know anything, Senpai?"@
`"Well, I know as much as anyone else does, but no, not the details.@
` It's just that… The word 'vampire' sends chills down my spine."\

`"Ah, you mean how it seems the victims have had their blood drained?@ Strange, isn't it?@ I wonder what it could mean?"@
`"Who knows?@ It's impossible to know how such people think.@ But I wonder why they've nicknamed him the 'vampire'?"@
`"……?"@
` What an odd question.\

`"Well, isn't it because the blood was drained from the bodies?@ It'd only be natural to call them vampires, wouldn't it?"@
play "track04.ogg"
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Do you know the folklore about vampires, Tohno-kun?"@
` Suddenly breaking into a smile, Senpai asks an even stranger question.\

`"…… Vampire folklore?@ …… You mean how people who have their blood sucked by vampires become vampires themselves?"\
`"Yes.@ If that was true, there shouldn't be any bodies left, right?@ Supposing some vampire was the killer, there'd be no bodies, Tohno-kun."@
`"---I see.@ That's true, but… it's just a nickname, isn't it?@ Do you really believe in vampires, Senpai?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Not at all.@ After all, the fact that the bodies are there show that it's not a vampire, right?"@
` Smiling, Senpai gives a reply that seems slightly off the point.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"But couldn't you also think of it this way?@
` Maybe the victims whose bodies have been found died because they couldn't become vampires.@
` Perhaps there are those who can be turned, and those who can't.@ The people who can become vampires won't have their corpses found even if they were attacked by vampires.@ Because even now, they're still alive--out there somewhere.@
` But those who can't become vampires just die, and so their bodies wind up being found."\

`"Well-----that's…"@
` …… Senpai is still smiling.@
` I know it's only a joke, but I'm having difficulty laughing it off.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, I'm just joking.@ It'd be like some kind of horror story if that were really true.@ I don't like scary stories, so please don't ask me things like that."@
`"…… What?@ It looked to me like you were really getting into it, Senpai."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, I don't like scary stories, but I do like scaring you, Tohno-kun."@

`"But all jokes aside, Tohno-kun, lately the streets have become dangerous at night.@
` You mustn't go out, even though you are an energetic young man."@
` Senpai gives me a warning that sounds like a joke.@ I can't tell how serious she is.\
