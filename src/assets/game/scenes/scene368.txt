` …… The lights are off and I can't quite make out the details of the room.@
` But, I can tell right away it isn't Akiha's room.\

`"This is Kohaku-san's room……!"@
` I kick the ground in the darkness.@
` Come to think of it, Akiha's room is exactly across from mine.@ In other words, the east wing on the second floor.@
`"Gah……!"@
` As I turn around to exit into the hallway, I see something lying on the ground.@
`"………?"@
` I squint my eyes in the dark.@
` I see----Hisui's figure collapsed on the floor.\

`"Hisui----!?"@
` I call out and run to her.@
`"…………… Mnh."@
` Hisui doesn't answer.@
` She's only peacefully breathing out in her sleep.@
`"Is she…… asleep?"@
` I can't believe it, but it seems so.@
` Hisui doesn't look like in pain.@ She really does seem like she's sleeping.@
` Just, there's a teacup tipped over on the table with the contents spilled.@
` The easiest explanation is there was a sleeping drug mixed into her tea and she fell asleep.\

`"----Kohaku-san isn't here?"@
` The only one collapsed in the room is Hisui.@
` …… Hisui seems to be just sleeping, so I have to make sure Akiha is safe----\

` …… I run up the stairs.\
` The heated air and sense of foreboding seem to stretch over the dark of night like glass.@
br
` ----*pant*, *pant*, *pant*.@
br
` Breathing heavily, I reach the top of the stairs and walk down the hallway…@
` …… My back hurts.@
` This terrible feeling in the air gets heavier as I draw near Akiha's room.\
