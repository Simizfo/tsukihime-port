`"Ah, you're here.@ That was a pretty fast sprint!@ You're looking pretty lively this morning, Shiki."@
`"-----"@
` …… My jaw hangs wide open.@
` As I sprint into the courtyard, Arcueid greets me with her usual radiance.\

`"It's smaller than I expected.@ I thought a 'school' would be much bigger than this----kyaa!"@
` I grab Arcueid's arm.@
`"----You, come with me."@
` Dragging Arcueid behind me, I dash to a place where people won't see us.\

` Arcueid seems to be disappointed in this place, but it's not like school is a really interesting place to begin with.@

`"---'What are you doing?' That's my line, Arcueid."@

`"Eh?@ What do you mean?"@
`"I'm asking why you're walking around during daytime, and why you came to my school.@ You haven't even healed yet, so why can't you just settle down and rest……!"@

`"But, since you said you would help me, I thought I would look for clues during the day.@ I didn't want to… make you do any extra work---"\

`"Don't worry about that!@ Since I said I'd help, any extra work we'll do together, so just forget about it.@
` …… Geez.@ You're weakest during the middle of the day yet you still leave.@ Do you just enjoy making me worry?"@
`"Ah---I'm, sorry."@
`"No, as long as you understand, it's okay---uh, Arcueid?"\

`"But you're at fault too, Shiki.@ I was watching for the longest time from the courtyard, but you never noticed me.@

` As usual, she completely lacks any common sense.\

`"…… Good.@ That wouldn't have been pretty if you did that."@
` I breathe a sigh of relief.@
` I don't think many people noticed her.@
` In the first place, there's only a few desks that can look out into the courtyard.\

`"---And?@ So why the heck did you come to my school?@ You said you were looking for clues."@

`"I just felt something from around here.@ Then I picked up your scent and realized it was your school."@

` I give a frown.@ Is she a dog or something?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well excuse me!@ I came here for a reason.@ There's hardly any traces of The Dead here, so I wanted to see it for myself."@
`"Really?@ But if there's no traces of The Dead here, then shouldn't this place be unimportant?@ There's no one at school at night, so if The Dead wanted some prey, they would go downtown, not to a school."@

` Even though most people don't stay by this grove, since it's lunchtime, there'll be lots of people walking by.\

` "Oh," Senpai answers without any enthusiasm.@
