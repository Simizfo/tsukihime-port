` I feel the morning sunlight.@
` I keep my eyes closed as I try to fall asleep again, but the gentle sunlight keeps urging me to open my eyes.@
br
` ---Slowly, I start to awaken.\

` A quiet atmosphere.@
` The air is comfortably cold, and the sunlight is warm enough.@
` I guess the weather will be great today.\

br
` ---Then, I should get up and go to school.@
br
` That's right, I have to go to school.@
` The past three days, my life was chaos and it made me forget I was a student.\

`"…………"@
` I wake up.@
` I'm lying on my bed, and my glasses are on the bedside.@
` I automatically put them on and look around.@
` The sunlight streams so strongly in through the window, I almost expect to hear it pouring through.@
`"----"@
` I take a quiet breath.@
` I fill my lungs with fresh air, and it feels like my chest is purified.\

` I hear the clock ticking.@
` Small birds chirp in the woods outside.@
` I stay on my warm bed, aimlessly feeling the relaxed passage of time.@
br
` -----This is, of course, another peaceful day.@
br
`"……………"@
` But, I feel a bit unsatisfied.\
` Although I'm back in this calm morning, I---feel that there is something that seems out of place.\

` Even though I killed that vampire with the black coat and everything is back the way it was---I'm feeling that something is missing.@
`"…… That's ridiculous."@
` I shake my head, and shake off that unimportant thought.@
br
` ---And then.@

` "Good morning, Shiki-sama."\

`"Uwaaaa!"@
` I jump up in my bed.@
` Now that I look, Hisui is standing quietly at the side of my bed.@
`"Hi-HiHi-Hisui---"@
`"…… Please excuse me, Shiki-sama, but since you did not notice, I spoke."@
`"Ah---well, I mean, I'm sorry, too."@
` Hisui respectfully bows to me.@
br
` ---Sh-she surprised me.@
` My heart is still pounding rapidly.\

`"---Huh?@ But it's still before seven o'clock, Hisui."@
`"Yes.@ It is a bit earlier than your usual waking time, Shiki-sama."@
`"Well, yes---then why are you here, Hisui?"@
`"I came to wake you up.@ Akiha-sama wants to know what have you been doing these last two days so she wanted me to bring you no matter what."@
`"-----Ah."\

` …… I forgot.@
` Come to think of it, I skipped school last Saturday and was with Arcueid through all of Sunday.@
` What's more, I came back late last night, snuck in like a burglar, and then went to sleep.\

`"…… Don't tell me, Akiha's angry……?"@
`"I do not know.@ Please confirm for yourself, Shiki-sama."@
br
` ---Hisui's voice sounds very cold.@
br
`"…… Hisui, you knew I came back?"@
`"Yes.@ I noticed when you returned early this morning around two o'clock.@ We saw you on the security camera when you were climbing the gate, Shiki-sama."\

`"---Um, does Akiha know this?"@
`"No, only Nee-san and I know this."@
`"That's---good."@
` …… Anyway, I think I avoided the worst possible situation.@
` However, it's still pretty bad.@
` Not informing her what I've been doing these last two days and returning in the middle of the night, it's pretty bad.\

`"---Alright.@ I'll head down immediately.@ Umm…… and, if possible, I'd be happy if you tried to calm her down as much as possible."@
`"Akiha-sama already appears calm.@ I think it will be difficult for my words to calm her even more."@
`"---"@
` Ugh, one problem after another?@
` I just got done with Nrvnqsr, so I never thought I would face another life and death battle without even a rest break.\

` Well, time to get up.@
` I can't do anything staying in bed.@
`"I'll go after I change, so please go ahead, Hisui.@ …… It's alright, I won't run."@
`"---Well then, we will be waiting for you."@

br
` …… *sigh*@
` Well then, I should change quickly so Mistress Akiha may pass judgment on me.\

` ---Alright, I'm here.@
` Now only a door separates me from the sitting room where Akiha awaits.@
` No matter what the circumstance was, there's no excuse for skipping school and not coming home for two days.@
` Now---
