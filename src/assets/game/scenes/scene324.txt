` …… What's bad you say?@ Hisui was bad.@
` Kohaku-san and Akiha seemed to be already used to drinking alcohol, but as far as Hisui is concerned, it was her first time seriously drinking.@
` Still, she drank to keep me company, trying hard to finish her glass.@ And this was what happened.\

`"Um, Hisui…?@ There's no reason for you to force yourself to drink like that."@
`"………"@
` Hisui nods.@
` And then, she takes the glass to her lips and she looks around aimlessly.@
` …… No matter how much I try to stop her, Hisui keeps sipping out of her glass.@
` …… I don't really understand it, but perhaps Hisui has taken a liking to alcohol.\

` ---And then…
br
`"Ah………"@
br

` With that, Hisui curls onto the sofa like a cat.@

`"Ahaha.@ You can't be doing that, Hisui-chan.@ If you sleep there, you'll catch a cold.@ Come on, Akiha-sama, please don't complain."@
` With a smile, Kohaku-san talks to the sleeping Akiha and Hisui.@
` …… It seems Kohaku-san is drunk too.\

`"…… It really was your first time, wasn't it, Hisui?"@
`"Yes.@ Hisui-chan has always been pretty weak with alcohol.@ Usually, she takes a sip and she turns completely red.@ Ahaha~!"@
` Kohaku-san laughs brightly.@
`"…… It seems like we have quite a problem, don't we?"\

`"Yes.@ Hisui-chan always turns down alcohol, but since Shiki-san offered, she pushed herself.@ She is normally not very sociable, so I guess she at least tried to keep you company.@ Isn't my sister so cute!?"@
` Bam-bam, Kohaku-san slaps my back.@
` …… Kohaku-san is quite drunk too…\

` Akiha complains in a murmuring voice.@
` It seems that Akiha doesn't like things she doesn't understand.@
` That's all good, but it seems when she's drunk, she doesn't understand anything… consequently, she has turned into a complaining machine…\

`"Well then, I will carry Akiha-sama, so Shiki-san, could you please take care of Hisui-chan?"@
`"Eh---wait a second Kohaku-san.@ I can't touch Hisui.@ I just brushed against her earlier and she hit me."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---That's right.@ Now that you mention it, Hisui-chan is a little obsessed about cleanliness.@ Even just holding hands with a man will cause her to throw up.@ If you hold her, I suppose there would be a problem."@
`"…… Just holding hands and throwing up……?"@
` That goes beyond just being obsessed with cleanliness.@
` I thought she was strange eight years ago, but Hisui----\

`"But, if Hisui-chan is sleeping, then it will be okay.@ Well, Akiha-sama, let's go back to your room."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

`"What?@ Wait, Kohaku-san!"@
` …… She doesn't respond.@
` With Akiha over her shoulders, she disappears out of the dining room.\

` What she left behind…
` A mountain of uneaten food, a mountain of empty bottles, and the contentedly sleeping Hisui, who is breathing softly on the sofa.@
br
` It truly is autumn.@
` Sleeping there like that, she will certainly catch a cold.\

`"…… Is it okay to touch Hisui like this?"@
` But, it can't be helped.@
` …… I don't have any bad intentions, and I do have to get her up to her room.@
`"…… Sorry.@ You can be mad at me later."@
` I lift up the sleeping Hisui.@
br
`"Ah……"@
` With just that, my heart begins to pound.\

`"…… Light."@
` Just like I thought, Hisui is very light.@
` Her delicate body fits in my arms.@
` Softness and the warmth of her body.@
`"…… This isn't good.@ I have to take her to her room quickly or I'll be the one in trouble."@
` So as not to wake Hisui, I slowly carry her out of the dining room.\

` I turn the doorknob to Hisui's room, and I stop, stunned.@
`"----No way."@
` It's locked.@
`"The key… must be in Hisui's pocket, right?"@
` This is bad.@ No, it's just reaching my hand in her pocket, but it's bad.@
` If I did that, who knows where my mind will go.@
`"…… Oh well, that's how it is."@
` Fortunately, both Hisui's room and my room are on the second floor.\

br
br
` ---Something seems… very familiar.\

` An old Japanese-style room.@
` A dark room.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---That is,
` that's an extremely old memory.\

` When I was very young, I wasn't used to the new people that took me in, so I locked myself up in my room.@
br
` I didn't care for anything; I didn't want to talk to anyone.@
` Always, always alone, and I wanted to be swaddled in the cradle of my happy memories.\
` Even if I knew there would be nothing like that for me ever again, I still wanted to do so.\

` Knock knock, came a sound.@
`"…… Who is it?"@
`"It's me."@
` Ah, she came again.@
` That girl around my age was knocking on the door again.@
`"Shiki-chan, let's play.@ You'll get moldy if you stay in a place like that."@
`"I don't wanna.@ I don't like going outside."@
` Hugging my knees, I huddled in a corner of the dark room.\

bg "image\bg\ima_06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


` …… That girl came every day.@
` She would always knock, never getting tired of it.@
` She would never force me out, so she would not open the door, but just continued to call my name.\

`"Why won't you come outside?"@
br
` Because there's no one that I know outside.@ Everyone hates me outside.@
br
`"That's not true.@ Everyone wants to like you, Shiki-kun."@
br
` Yes.@ I knew that, but I couldn't believe it.@ Because my father went outside, and---\

br
br
br
br
br
` And.@
` He was torn to pieces.\

`"…… I see.@ No wonder you can't believe anyone."@
br
` Yeah, that's why I will always stay here.@ I don't want any more scary things happening.@
br
`"But, you will just be by yourself all the time.@ Being by yourself is no fun."@
br
` Even if it's no fun, it is better than being scared.\

`"That's, that's not fun at all.@ Then, Shiki-chan, you can believe in me."@
br
` …… You say I can believe in you.@ That's a little backwards.@ Don't people normally say, "I believe you?"@
br
`"It's okay!@ Shiki-chan, you can believe in me and come out!"@
br
` …… Fine.@ But, believe… what should I believe in?\

`"Simple.@ Even if everyone hates you, I will still like you, Shiki-chan.@ Because I like you, I always come and ask you to play."@
br
` ……… Is outside, fun?@
br
`"Yeah!@ It's much, much more fun than being by yourself-----!"@

bg "image\bg\ima_11.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid


br
br
` ----And then, I went outside.\
br

` that was my first memory as Tohno Shiki----\

` I don't know why, but Hisui is sleeping in my bed.@
` A-And that's not all.@ At the same time, leaning right up against me, is her completely unguarded sleeping face.\

`"Ah----"@

` My sleepiness disappears in a flash.@

` …… Her peaceful, sleeping face.@
` For now, just being able to see that so closely, makes me not care about anything else.\

`"…………"@
` I'm completely absorbed.@
` It's not that I didn't realize it before, but Hisui is really pretty.@
` It's not that she just has a beautiful face.@ Rather, her graceful atmosphere, I can't help but think that it is pretty.@
`"……………… Hisui."@
` If I could, I would like to stay this way forever.@
` But that can't happen… Besides, unless Hisui wakes up soon, there will be a lot of trouble.\

`"…… Hisui.@ Hey, Hisui."@
` …… I call, but she doesn't seem to wake up.@
`"Hey, it's morning.@ Isn't it time to get up?"@
` I gently shake Hisui.\

`"Hisui.@ Wake up, Hisui."@
`"U… nh."@
` Hisui's fingers start to twitch.@
` Hisui's eyelids slowly open, like melting ice.\

`"……… Mm."@
` Waveringly stretching out her arms, Hisui wakes up.@
` She looks around the room rubbing her eyes for a few seconds.@
` Hisui finally grasps the fact that she is in my room, and the fact that I am right in front of her.\

`"Kyaaa!"@
` Hisui jumps up from the bed.@

`"I… I can't explain it very well, but do you remember about last night?"@

`"You remembered?"@

`"Yes…… I caused you a lot of trouble, Shiki-sama."@
` With flushed cheeks, Hisui looks right at me.@
`"…… Sorry about that.@ I went to your room, but it was locked and I couldn't enter.@
` I thought you could sleep in my room while I went to get Kohaku-san, but the alcohol got to me and just like that, I fell asleep."@
` …… Yeah, that's exactly how I remember it.@
` But that's odd, last night I thought for sure…\

`"…… That's odd, I thought that I went to sleep on the carpet, but… sometime during the night I must have got on the bed.@
` Ah, I wasn't thinking of doing anything weird to you, Hisui!@ I just now woke up too……!"@
`"…………"@
` Hisui stares at me silently.\

`"I, I mean it!@ I didn't have a choice, Kohaku-san had to take care of Akiha, and I couldn't just leave you alone like that!@ …… I apologize for holding you, and I was ready for you to get mad at me for doing that!"@
` Trying to answer Hisui's direct gaze, and I try my utmost to explain.@
`"……………"@
` Hisui doesn't answer; she just looks over her clothes and nods.\

`"Good----"@
` I breathe a sigh of relief.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t26.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"And I think the one who placed you on the bed… was me.@ I woke up once during the night and saw you sleeping on the floor.@ I did not want you to catch a cold, so I remember getting you to sleep on the bed."@

` If that's true, then that would explain why I was in bed, but why was Hisui sleeping on the bed too?\

`"I-I see.@ Certainly, that's how you think when you are drunk.@ Hahaha."@
` I start to laugh for some reason.@
` Embarrassed, Hisui drops her shoulders.@
` …… Why is it?@
` Even though I was only sleeping next to her, I get so conscious of Hisui, I am unable to say anything clearly.\

`"A, anyway, let's just keep this a secret between us.@ If Akiha knew about it, she'd get angry, and if Kohaku-san knew about it, she'd just tease us about it relentlessly."@

`"---Yes.@ If Shiki-sama will allow it, then it will help me as well."@
`"Yeah, sorry Hisui.@ If I was more responsible, this thing would never have happened."@

` Nothing did happen, but it's still a fact that I carried a girl to my room and slept next to her.@
` No matter what Hisui says, I think I'm responsible.\

`"Not at all, it is my fault.@ If I was more responsible, then you would never have had to worry about any of this, Shiki-sama."@

`"Nii-san, what are these, 'breakdown enzymes'?"\

`"Well, I'll make it short.@ After alcohol enters the body, I guess it changes to some kind of poison.@
` The poison is processed by the liver by these enzymes that break down the alcohol into water.@
` The amount of enzymes in each person is different, and Japanese people tend to have less than others.@ You can say those that have less enzymes have to moderate a little."@
