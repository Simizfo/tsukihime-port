` ----I'll go to Arcueid's room.@
br
` If Arcueid is as weak as Senpai says, she had to have returned to her room to rest.\

` I gasp for air.@
` My legs, which ran as hard as they could, finally stop.@
` Trying to catch my breath, I enter the apartment.\

` …… I grab the doorknob.@
` It isn't locked.@
` Without hesitating, I turn it and open the door.\

` …… Even though it wasn't locked, there's no one here.\
br
`"Arcueid…… are you here?"@
br
` There's no response.@
` Does she never lock her door?@ There's no sign of her having even returned here.\

`"Damn…… Then she's still in town……!?"@
` I hit the wall.@
` But letting it out on the wall is not going to get Arcueid to come out.@
`"…… Where did you go…… where did you go, Arcueid……!?"@
br
` ------If there really is a God, I want to ask him for help.\

` Arcueid isn't here.@
` But I can't find her just running around aimlessly.@
` At this rate I'll never----never see her again.@
br
`"------"@
` No, I'm not done yet.@
` I still haven't fulfilled my promise with Arcueid.@ The promise to help her defeat the vampire, and the promise to meet tonight so we can fight together.\

`"…… Pro…… mise……"@
` …… That's right.@ There's still our promise.@
` Even if it's just one-sided, I----even if it's just me, I'll fulfill our promise.\

` I return to the park.@
` Our promise still remains here.@
` Our unfulfilled promise for tonight remains here.@
br
` ----So,
` If I can't break this promise, and if she thinks it's important too,
br
` Arcueid will come back here.@
` I can only continue to believe in her and wait here.\
