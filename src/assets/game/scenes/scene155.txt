` --That's right.@
` No matter how hard I try, I can't hide it from Hisui and Kohaku-san who are in charge of maintaining the mansion.@
` So, the least I can do is let them know when I'll be gone every night in the following days.\

`"…… Yeah, to tell the truth, I'll probably leave for a number of nights starting now.@ I swear I'm not just playing around or doing anything bad.@ Akiha will probably end up hating me, but I can't stop now."@
br
` Yeah.@ The vampire is still somewhere in town preying on victims.@
` As a person who lives here, I just can't pretend like I didn't see it.\

`"---I know it's a burden to you, Hisui, but please overlook it.@ I don't know what time I'll be back, so please just leave the gate unlocked."@

`"Shiki-sama, are you saying you will not tell us why?"@
`"…… Yeah, sorry Hisui.@ You can think I'm totally irresponsible, but please don't ask.@ I, don't want to have to lie."@
`"…… No.@ You are my master.@ A servant does not despise her master like that."@
` She speaks plainly and without any expression.@
` The conversation ends and I go up to return to my room.\

`"…… Forgive, my impertinence, but…"@
` After cutting off, she tightens both of her hands as she looks over at me.@

`"If you would like me to, Shiki-sama, I can keep your leaving a secret from Akiha-sama."@
`"Eh?@ You mean, you're not---going to tell?"@
`"---Yes.@ After dinner, it is extremely rare for Akiha-sama to leave her room.@ Nee-san and I are responsible for conducting a patrol right before she sleeps, so if I do not tell the truth, she will not know."\

`"Yeah, that helps.@ It helps, but…… is that okay?@ Isn't she your employer?"@

`"I told you you are my master, Shiki-sama."@
br
` ---uh…… I'm, kind of happy.@
` I always have to tell her to stop adding "sama", but at times like this, I think I'm incredibly lucky.@ How can I help but be happy?\

`"Yeah----that helps, so if you can, please do so."@

`"Then please use the rear entrance tonight.@ The front entrance will be locked, but if you have the key and use the servant's entrance, you can come and leave undetected."@
`"Oh?@ There's a servant's entrance?@ No wonder I never saw you leave through the gate."@
`"No, the only one who uses that is Nee-san.@ She has the key, so I will get it to you later."@

` "Well then", she says, after which she bows and disappears.\

`"-----Alright!"@
` Help just came from an unexpected source.@
` With this, it seems I can keep my promise with Arcueid without worrying Akiha.\

` After dinner, I go back to my room.@
` It's almost ten o'clock.@
` While I was eating, Hisui placed the key on my desk.@
br
`"Now then---shall I go?"@
` Placing my knife in my pocket, I leave my room as quietly as I can.\
