` Fourth period class is about modern society.@
` The mood in the classroom is somewhat lighter than usual before lunch.@
br
` Today is Wednesday, so there's one less hour of classes than usual.@
` After lunch, there's homeroom and an hour of deciding what to do for the Culture Festival.@
` What's more, tomorrow is a school holiday, so after this fourth period is over, it's practically vacation already.@
` It's only natural for everyone to be waiting for the end-of-class bell to ring.\

`"----Sleepy."@
` I give a big yawn.@
` The class is completely unchanged, the whole day progresses with nothing out of the ordinary.@
br
` Come to think of it, I've been through so many strange experiences, I almost feel odd just sitting in class.@
` And after classes are over and night falls, I'll have to go out once more with Arcueid.@
` Thinking of that, I really don't have the time to be fooling around here.\

` I look at my reflection in the window glass.@
` Tohno Shiki's face seems to be happy for some reason.@
`"----Grr."@
` I tighten my expression.@
` It's not like roaming the streets with Arcueid is fun, so why am I acting like this?@

`"…… Arcueid……"@
` There's really, something wrong.@
` Looking out the window and into the rear courtyard, I can see an illusion of her waving her hand at me and saying "Hey".\

`"Wha, wha, wha----"@
` I push myself onto the window and look down.@
` I can only see the very edge of the rear courtyard,
` but without a doubt,
` Arcueid, in her usual manner, is at my school.\

`"!!!!!"@
` I look around the classroom.@
br
` ----Fortunately, there's no one who noticed the strange foreigner waving to me.\

`"What is she thinking……!?"@
` I moan to myself as I clutch my head.@
` But, complaining does me no good.@
` …… There's about twenty minutes till lunch.@
` What are you going to do Shiki?@ If you leave her alone, who knows what she'll do……!?@
