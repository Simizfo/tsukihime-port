` I walk along a different path than the one I usually take.@
` Passing through unfamiliar streets, I slowly approach the Tohno mansion.@
` The surroundings are not completely unfamiliar.@
` After all, I had lived here until I was nine years old---eight years ago.@ This is not the first time I have taken this path back to the mansion.@
` …… My feelings are a little complex.@
` The path home is nostalgic, yet fresh.@
` Up until just now, I had not looked forward to returning to the Tohno household.@ Now, it doesn't seem so bad.\

` …… The house I lived in until I was nine years old.@
` Right now, my sister Akiha is in that utterly un-Japanese western-style mansion.@
` Tohno Makihisa--My old man who hated me, and the master of the Tohno household, died a few days ago.\

` My mother died from illness after Akiha was born, so the Tohnos had dwindled down to me and my sister.@
` Being the eldest son, you would think I would stand to become the Tohno heir… but I have no such privilege.\

` To become the Tohno heir means being bound by a strict upbringing.@
` I have lost count of the number of times my father scolded me over my dislike of not being able to live freely.@
` That was when I got involved in that accident, and my body became weakened… My father saw it as a good opportunity to get rid of me.@
` His reasoning was something along the lines of "someone who could die any moment can't become the heir, even if he is the eldest son".@
` Sadly for my father, I betrayed his expectations by making a recovery, but my sister Akiha was already deemed to be the heir to the Tohno household.\

` And so I've heard that Akiha, who was already being raised harshly in order to become a proper daughter of the Tohno household, received an even harsher upbringing since then.@
` That was a long time ago--I played together with Akiha in the mansion back before the accident.@ After that, I never saw her again.\
