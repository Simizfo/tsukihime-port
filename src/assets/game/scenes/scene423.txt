` The distant moon.@

` It only has one eye.@
` The eye shines with red light.@
` Looking like it's floating in empty air, its very existence screams abnormally.@
` Since there is only one eye, its color doubles?@
` Compared to that eye, the fresh blood seems like the chrome yellow of a far-off mountain.\

` A scarlet deeper than red.@
` A name for that has been passed down in the Nanaya oral tradition.@
` Crimson Red Vermillion.@
` A name that points to an existence that has awakened to the nonhuman blood of its ancestors.@
` It describes a person whose ego is subsumed by a transcendental self and loses all sanity.\

` It is said that the red Evil Eye is a sign of being possessed.@
` Like a mirage, something shimmers behind it.@
` Laughing around aimlessly as if insane.@
` It doesn't look like it's having any fun.@
` With the reed warbler's cry, its body becomes hazy.@

` It disappears as if eaten by the surrounding bush.\


` …… A voice calls me from the distance.@
` I'm scared to be alone, so I should go towards the forest.@

` My power is really the opposite, but I guess I put that curse on you.@
` You miraculously recovered and ever since that day I have carried a load…… come to think of it, it was only natural.@ It is because I shared half of my life with you, Nii-san."\

`"---------"@
` Everything goes black.@
` So I am alive because of Akiha, and at the same time---because of that, Akiha has to live with that terminal illness?\

`"…… Akiha.@ That time you had that fit, it was all---my fault?"@
`"…… Yes.@ As long as I keep you alive, I have to use the powers of the Tohno blood.@ If I do that, my human blood becomes thinned.@
` If it becomes too weak, I will become something less than human, just like SHIKI.@
` To prevent that, I have to only use the minimum of my powers.@ But if I do that, I can only maintain your life and I can't support my own body."\

`"…… As a result, those fits occur.@ Sensing the danger, my body tells me to stop providing you with energy or just become one with the Tohno blood.@
` It is only thanks to Kohaku that I have been able to resist it this long.@ As a Synchronizer, she can strengthen one's will.@ I regularly drank her blood to strengthen the human part of Tohno Akiha."\

` Before I realize it, my whole body staggers.@
` Akiha.@ Akiha's sucking of blood.@
` It's completely my fault.@
` As long as I'm alive, Akiha has to live as the Tohno---\


`"But, I thought if I killed SHIKI it would be solved.@ If SHIKI died, then he would no longer be able to steal your life."@
`"-----Ah."@
` …… That's right.@
` If SHIKI is no longer alive, then I could have my life to myself, so I wouldn't be anemic anymore.\

`"Hehe.@ But, it really is funny.@ If anyone other than me had killed SHIKI, then you would have been back to normal.@
` Didn't I tell you?@ I stole everything from SHIKI.@ I do not have the power to synchronize like Kohaku.@ What I stole, I cannot give to anyone else."@
br
` She strangely gives a heartfelt smile in pure self-deprecation.\

`"After killing SHIKI, I felt a weight lifted from me.@ Those spasms I had every evening did not occur, and I felt great.@
` …… I do not need to say why, do I?@ Because, in place of SHIKI, I am now stealing your life.@
` But, I just took it and I can't give it back to you, Nii-san.@ Unlike SHIKI, I do not have the ability to fuse."\

`"…… Yes, you were fused with SHIKI.@ Certainly, SHIKI took away life from you, but it returned to you when he slept.@
` But that is no longer the case.@ That is why you have trouble moving now.@ That is why I have to continue supplying you with energy more than before.@
` …… For that reason, I need to accumulate energy from people's blood."@
br
` After saying this, Akiha walks away from the glowing red window.\
