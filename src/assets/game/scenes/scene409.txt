` A terrible silence.@
` I can't even hear the wheezing of my breathing.\

`"---------"@
` Being by myself all night caused my body to become really weak.@
` My vision is really blurry.@
` The air touching my skin is painful.@
` My organs are so screwed up now that I can't breathe unless I concentrate.\

` …… How many times is this?@ Hisui really doesn't grow tired of this at all.@
`"You are awake, are you not?@ If that is the case, then please at least eat."@
`"…… No.@ I won't eat what any of you give me."@
` I won't eat anything.@
` I can't trust anything that comes from this house.@
` Food.@ Water.@ Medicine.@
` It seems like everything is a poison to kill me.\

`"…… Shiki-sama, I will place your food here.@ After I leave, please open the door and eat it."@

` …… Hisui's presence recedes.@
`"………"@
` I bang my head against the wall.@
` …… How many times have I ignored Hisui like this?@
` …… Hisui.@ Hisui is different from Akiha and Kohaku-san.@
` Maybe Hisui is not trying to kill me.\

`"………"@
` But, that is just a fantasy.@
` Hisui tried to lock me in this room.@
` Like right now, she came to my room to look after me, keeping me trapped in this room.@
`"----Ha, ah."@
` …… This is no good.@
` I know my thoughts are just paranoia.@
` But my mind won't return to normal.\

` …… Knock,  Knock Knock, Knock.@
` …… Knock,  Knock Knock, Knock.@
` …… Knock,  Knock Knock, Knock.@
` …… Knock,  Knock Knock, Knock.@

` My mind is foggy and my body pulses with pain.@
` My throat is so dry that it feels like I will die if I don't drink water.@
` …… In spite of all that, I still keep the door locked.\
