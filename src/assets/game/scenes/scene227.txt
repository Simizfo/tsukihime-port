` Is Arihiko that pleased just to be with Senpai?@ He happily asks me for agreement.@
` Well, for once we do seem to be in agreement.\


`"That's right.@ You really helped me out by coming, Senpai.@ I don't know what I would've done if I had to eat while staring at this guy's face."@

`"……… Alright."@
` I take a bite from my bread.@
` I still have no appetite, so I forcefully wash it down with some milk.@

` Arihiko holds a lively conversation with Senpai since they are both done with lunch.@
` They talk about the strange events like serial murders and whatnot, which really does not help my appetite.\

`"Nah, I don't have time to do anything in the morning so I didn't watch it."@
`"That's no good you know, staying up late at night.@ You shouldn't walk around at night, there's some scary people out there."\

` "Ahahaha." The two of them laugh.@

` …… Hm, Ciel-senpai might be serious, but Arihiko probably said that as a joke.@
` "Hahaha." Arihiko's eyes twitch as he smiles.\


` Anyway, I can't exactly ignore their conversation.\

`"…… Oh, close to the park."@

` As soon as I say that, the contents of my stomach threaten to rise up.\

` --Last night.@

` That unknown girl who just by chance was by the park, was destroyed by that irrational violence.@
` Missing might be a better description, since she was devoured without even so much as a hair left behind.\

` There's a small one in Kohaku-san's room, but I'm not about to barge into a girl's room in the morning."@

`"You can't just say that and get away with it, Tohno."@
` They're both glaring at me.@
` I slap my hand over my mouth, but it's far too late.\

`"Uh, um--simply put, just that there's a servant at my house named Kohaku-san."@

`"Huh, a servant?@ You're really lucky to have a girl around you at all times to take care of your every need."@
`"That's not it!@ There isn't anyone to take care of the mansion, so we have to hire people to do it.@
` Whether she's male or female is entirely irrelevant."\

`"Oh reeeeallly?@ Hey Inui-kun, doesn't Tohno-kun sound real intimate with this Kohaku-san?@
`"Yeah yeah, he looked so happy when he said her name.@ I wanted to ask before, but just what kind of a life does Tohno lead right now?"@
