` Oh, I know what.@ If that stray dog barks again tonight, perhaps we shall start keeping an extra-vicious guard dog here."@

` It's not heavy at all.\

`"…… Kohaku-san, I've never seen this before."@
`"Well… apparently it was left to you by your departed father.@ It was to be given to you in the will."@
`"…… By my old man?"@

` With a dry sound, the wooden box opens.@
` Inside, there is----a ten-centimeter bar of thin iron.\

`"…… It's… an iron bar."@
` Undecorated and worn, it has finger marks all over it.@
` …… The old man must have really hated me to leave me a piece of junk like this.\

`"No, Shiki-san.@ It's a fruit knife."@
` Kohaku-san takes the iron bar out of the box.@
`"See, isn't it one of those folding knifes?@ One, two… three!"@
` With a "pachink!", a ten-centimeter blade pops out from the bar.@
` …… I see, it certainly is a knife.\

`"It's old, but it seems pretty solid.@ The year and the era it was made in is written on the back."@
` Kohaku-san replaces the blade, and hands over the knife.@

` Certainly, there's a number written on the grip.@
` The character 'seven', and under it, the character 'night'.\

`"Nee-san, there is no era by that name.@ It just says 'Nanatsu-yoru'."@

` Hisui, who had been silent until now, was looking at the knife over my shoulder.\

` …… Hmmm.@ In its own way, I guess it's not such a bad inheritance.\
