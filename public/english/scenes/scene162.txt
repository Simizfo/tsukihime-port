` …… Is the window open?@
` I can hear the soft singing of birds from the garden.@
` A cool breeze blows across my face.@
` I feel the sunlight hitting my eyelids.@
` A quiet, gentle atmosphere.@
br
` A gentle morning.\

` Morning?@
` I guess I fell asleep last night as Akiha cared for me, and slept till now.@
` Lying down, my body feels heavy.@
` But I feel much better than I did yesterday.@
` I decide to open my eyes and sit up.@
br
` And----\

br
` …… I see Arcueid's face right in front of mine.\

`"………!?"@
` My brain goes blank and stops working due to this unexpected event.@
` My mouth opens and closes, but my voice seems to be missing.@
br
` ---Seriously, what's going on?\

` Arcueid is in front of me.@
` This is my room.@
` It's past nine o'clock in the morning,
` She's come inside, still wearing her shoes; that's all I know for now.\

`"Y-Y-Y-You!"@
`"Liar.@ We promised to meet again yesterday."@
` She must be in a pretty bad mood as her red eyes have lost their usual beauty.@
br
` ---No, not lost at all.@
` Being this close, her beauty is more vivid than usual.\

` Arcueid glares at me as I lay in bed.@
br
`"…… W-Wait, Arcueid.@ W-Why are you in my room this morning……!?"@
` I start to shout, but I stop myself.@
` If I shouted now, Hisui would come here and it would all be over.@
br
` ---Everything is still chaotic, but my brain can grasp that much.\

`"A-Anyway, move……!@ Just going into someone's room, threatening a sleeping person, don't you know how awful that is……!?"@
`"What's with that attitude?@ I came here because you broke your promise.@ Sleeping while making someone wait, just what in the world were you planning?"@
` She stares at me ill-temperedly.\

` …… I calm down.@
br
` That's right.@ I really did break my promise to meet Arcueid last night.\

`"…… Mmmm."@
` I finally understand the situation.@
` I understand why Arcueid's angry.@
` I understand, but to do this… to come into someone's room still wearing shoes like that, what does she intend to do?@
` Seeing that the window is open, she probably came in through there.\

`"…… I see, since I broke my promise, I'm at fault here.@ But sneaking in here is going a little far, you know."@
`"This isn't your house, Shiki."@
` She gives a quick retort.\

`"You know, I really was angry before.@ I waited for many hours, and as soon as I realized you weren't coming, I got so incredibly angry.@
` I was thinking I would never let this happen again and I'd rip your throat out."@
` She speaks, still looking ill-tempered.\

`"Do you get it, Shiki?@ That feeling, I couldn't resist it.@ Even though I know I should calm down, the more I thought about it, the angrier I got."@
` As if she still felt that way, her red eyes seem to blame me.@
br
`"Yeah… I guess you can't help yourself."@
` Giving thanks to God my neck is still attached, I keep the conversation going.\

`"Isn't it?@ And I snuck in here, but since you were sleeping I decided to wait.@ At least I wanted to hear your excuse.@
` And, since I didn't have anything to do, I watched your sleeping face.@ …… Yeah, your sleeping face was very quiet, it was almost scary.@
` Sleeping like you were dead, I started feeling uneasy because I thought that maybe you would never wake up."@
` I sigh.@
`"If you were uneasy then you should've woke me.@ I'm uneasy when you're next to me."\

`"But, I thought it would be a waste.@
` …… I don't know what I look like when I sleep, but I thought it would be real good if I slept like you did.@
` I wondered why you look so peaceful while I watched you sleep.@
` While I was doing that, my anger disappeared, and then you woke up."\

`"…… Then you've been here this whole time?@ From last night until now?"@
`"Yeah.@ People from this house came in a few times, but I hid myself so it was okay.@
` A girl also came to wake you up, but I didn't like her so I sent her away."@
` Arcueid laughs brightly.\

`"Wait, you sent her away?@ How?"@
`"I wasn't rough.@ Didn't I tell you before that vampires have Mystic Eyes of Enchantment?@ I merely used suggestion on her, saying that 'Shiki has already gone to school' and didn't leave any memory of her meeting me."@
`"No memory?@ You……"@
` Really are a troublesome person.@
` …… Well, even if she is troublesome, at least she took care not to be detected.\

` I bring my hands to my head as I sigh.@
`"Alright.@ Sorry for yesterday, Arcueid.@ I don't know if this is making up for it, but I won't break any more promises.@ Yeah, I promise."@
` I look her right in the eye as I declare this.\

`"Are you sure?"@
`"I'm sure.@ Because I now realize your revenge is scary……"@
` Still lying down, I raise my hands in surrender.@
br
` All of a sudden, her bad mood disappears completely.@ Arcueid gives a satisfied nod and says 'alright'.\

` Arcueid finally gets away from the bed.@
`"…… Geez, sneaking onto someone's bed like that.@ Didn't you think about how hard the sheets would be to clean if you left a mess from your shoes?"@
` Complaining, I get up from bed.@
` Arcueid stands in the center of the room watching me as I slowly rouse myself from bed.@
`"…… Hey, what are you doing?"\

`"What am I doing?@ I'm just waiting for you to change.@ You're not going to go out in those clothes, right?"@
`"Well, yeah.@ No one walks around in pajamas… Wait, Arcueid?"@
`"Yeah, I was thinking we'd spend the day together, Shiki.@ You said you'd make it up for breaking your promise, didn't you?"@
` Arcueid says this casually, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.\

`"Today, all day… What are you saying?@ I have school…"@
