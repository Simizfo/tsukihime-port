` Left by myself, I lie on my bed.@
` This house from eight years ago…
` My blood relative from eight years ago…
` It feels a little like they belong to someone else.@
` *sigh*@
`"…… I wonder what's going to happen to me now?"@
` Grumbling to no one in particular, I fall asleep.\

` Awooooo.@
br
` ---I hear the wave-like sound of something's voice.\
br
` Awooooo.@
br
` ---Something is howling.@ It's too sharp and high-pitched to be a stray dog.\

br
` Awooooo.@
br
` ---It echoes in my eardrums.@ Is it howling at the moon?\

br
` Awooooo.@
br
` ---This doesn't feel right.@ The beastly howling is beginning to give me a headache.\

br
` Awooooo.@
br
` ---It doesn't stop.\

br
` Awooooo.@
br
` Awooooo.@
br
` Awooooooooooooooo---\

`"…… Argh, just shut up already!"@
br
` I wake up.@
` I can hear the sound of a dog barking outside the window.@
` The clock indicates it is just past eleven.@
` This is more than just a neighborhood nuisance.\

`"Damn, I can't sleep like this!"@
` The dog's howling comes from somewhere near the mansion's fence.@
br
` …… It doesn't seem like I can go back to sleep at this rate.@
