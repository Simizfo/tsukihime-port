` My old man's room is just like it always was.@
` Nearly all of the rows of books are educational reports, and nothing catches my attention.@
` What I want right now is my old man's journal or notes.@
` The old man was extremely methodical.@ There certainly has to be something like that lying around here somewhere---
`"…… Of course, they're not just lying about where anyone can see them."@
` Maybe they're locked away somewhere.@
` I should probably look in these desk drawers first.\

` Using a letter opener lying on the desk, I cut the "line" of the drawer lock.@
` Inside, there appears to be some old documents bundled together and what seems to be a journal.\

` First, I'll look at the old documents.@
`"…… This is… my family tree?"@
` Definitely.@
` Right after Tohno MAKIHISA is written Tohno SHIKI and Tohno AKIHA.@
br
`"Huh…… my old man, he adopted a son ten years ago?@ …… Ah, but he passed away shortly thereafter."@
` Ten years ago; that would be when I was just in elementary school.@
` That long ago, it's only natural I wouldn't remember.\

`"But, the heads of the household have had pretty short lifespans.@ My old man died before he was fifty, and before that, before thirty in an accident…… Wow, before that, eighteen years of age, suicide…!?"@
br
` ----No, wait a second.@
` No matter how you look at it, this is strange.@

` Looking through the family tree, all members of the Tohno household have died strangely.@
` Madness.@ Accidents.@ Murder.@ Disappearances.@ Stillbirth.@
` …… Not one of them lived a long life or even died peacefully.\

`"Wha…………"@
` This entire document is filled with horrible fates.@
` Even worse, most of the causes of death are madness.@
` Most of them ended up taking their own lives.@
`"That's strange---it's just strange."@
` But I can't exactly tell what's strange about it.\

`"…… Next is…… my old man's journal."@
` I pick up the journal, which has a relatively new binding.@
br
` ----Thump.@
br
` My heart starts to pound.@
` My heart seems to understand that I shouldn't be opening this.@
` But I can't turn back now.@
` Swallowing hard, I open my old man's journal.\

br
` ------There is a demon lurking inside the Tohno bloodline.\

` The opening statement is in those lines.@
br
` And that isn't just a simple metaphor.@
` The ancestors of the Tohno were a mixed breed of "something nonhuman" and human.@ We, being their descendants, also have this element of "something nonhuman" in our blood.\

` In regards to our blood…
` There are those with strong and those with weak nonhuman blood.@
` Those with weak nonhuman blood can live their lives as ordinary people, but those with strong nonhuman blood can never live a normal life.@
br
` Those with strong Tohno blood are born with special powers.@
` It could be a body that is resistant to death,
` it could be an ability to move things without touching them,
` or it could be fangs used to take bodily fluids from other people.\

` This blood.@
` When this blood becomes too strong, the members of the Tohno House start to gradually lose their sanity.@
` And the majority of the members of the Tohno House that lose their sanity become demons that feed on human flesh.@
` So, the head of the Tohno household carries the responsibility of punishing those who have turned into such monsters.\

`"--------Ha."@
` …… It's messed up.@
` My old man, what was he trying to say?@
` Writing so seriously about something that's more like a fairy tale.@
br
` The journal turns more into the old man's rant.@
br
` The date is roughly nine years ago.@
` The handwriting starts to get erratic.\

` …… I am no longer able to suppress my raging blood.@
` I was able to obtain an orphan from a family of Synchronizers, so this should help me strengthen my mind.@ However, it really is only a matter of time before I go insane.\

` …… It is terrifying.@
` When I come to, I find that I can't even remember half of the day.@
` During that time, I'm forcing my inversion impulse on that child.@
` If this keeps up,
` it is only a matter of time before I completely lose my sanity and turn into a beast.@
` I don't even know how much time I have left to remain as myself.\

` No.@ If that child is here, then I can probably last for a few more years.@
` But that child will not be able to bear that.@ After that child breaks, I will have to take my own life.@
br
` But until then---I must protect my children.@
` Akiha's blood is weak.@ Unless she wishes it herself, she does not have to suffer the same fate.\

` The real problem is SHIKI.@
` That child is incredibly close to me.@
` More than anything, I do not want that child to suffer my fate.@
` …… If the Tohno blood is unnatural, I need to distance him as much as possible from the Tohno name and see how he will fare-----\

`"---------"@
` I finish reading in a state of horror and amazement.@
` The contents of my old man's journal are so far away from reality that it's outright bizarre.@
br
` My old man didn't just have manic-depression.@
` Rather, he just became violent without his knowing.@
` Just like Tohno Shiki right now.\

`"…… No."@
` That's wrong.@
` That old man isn't like me.@
` I'm like him.\

` Fearing that, he sent me from the mansion.@
` But now I've returned, and my sleeping blood has awoken.@
`"Heh…… nonsense, all of this."@
` I try to laugh but find myself unable to laugh it off.@
` The Tohno blood is mixed with the blood of something nonhuman.@
` Those of the Tohno blood have special powers.@
` …… I can't laugh it off.@
` Supernatural power.@ I've been carrying that for eight years.@
` Being able to perceive the death of things, my unnatural eyes.\
