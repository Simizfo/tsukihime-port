` ----I value my life.\

` I recall the scene yesterday when I killed Arcueid.@
` The stench of death and blood.@ ---I never want to experience something like that again.@
` If I were to remain with Arcueid, there'd be no question that I would be subjected to that scene again.@ If I don't want that, I'll have to go back to the mansion.\

`"------"@
` …… I get the feeling that there's some major flaw in my decision.@
` But right now, everything is a mess in my head and my sense of logic refuses to function properly.@
` Anyhow, for now, I'll return to my own room for some rest.@ I'm sure I'll calm down and think clearer then.\

` The sun has gone down, and my surroundings have been cast into darkness.@
` It's probably past seven now.@
` The curfew for the mansion is eight, so I'd better hurry back if I don't want to be scolded by Akiha.\

` The streets around the mansion are deserted like always.@
` The sun's only just gone down, but the silence is like that of midnight.\

`"Come to think of it, this place is…"@
` Where I've gone to check out that noisy stray dog the night I first returned to the mansion.@

`"Huh……?"@
` I'm beset by a terrible premonition of misfortune.\

` ----Strange.@
` Suddenly, my surroundings became completely black.\

` I hear a dripping sound.@
` …… Where's that sound coming from?@
` It's coming from nearby.@
` My body is starting to cool.@
` It's coming from nearby.@
` Alarms are going off somewhere in my head.\

` The sound…

`"Ah----"@

` I collapse onto the asphalt.@
` My limbs won't move, and my consciousness dims.\
