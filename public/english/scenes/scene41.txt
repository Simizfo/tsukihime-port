` It might be cynical of me to say so, but the world has certainly become a convenient place.\

`"…… I am sorry.@ It is somewhat comforting to hear you say that."\
` Akiha's face is serious, but this is not a topic I care much about.@
` A funeral is a ceremony for those who cannot not detach their feelings for the deceased to achieve such detachment.@ For someone like me, who cut off such feelings a long time ago, there is no need.\
