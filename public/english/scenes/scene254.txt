` I look away from her and refuse.@
` But Arcueid keeps saying "Come on, come on," over and over.\

`"Come on, tell me.@ You can at least tell me who you dreamed about."@
` She asks like a curious kid.@
` Every time I turn away she keeps jumping in front of me, saying "Come on, come on."@

` …… This is pure torture.@
` She's as mischievous as last night's dream.\

` I bury my face in my hands.@
