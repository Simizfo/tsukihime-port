` …… I go up the residential hill and arrive at the outskirts of the mansion.@
` It's around two in the morning.@
` As expected, I'm totally assailed by sleepiness.@

`"…… I wonder if she's going to be okay."@
` I'm concerned about how she seemed when we parted.@
` It seemed like it wasn't pain from her wound, but---\

`"Hm?"@
br
` What is that?@
` It feels like there's someone lurking in the shadows not illuminated by the streetlights.\

` My heart stops my breath.@
` My blood rushes through my body, this sensation----\

` The figure gets closer and closer.@
br
` Footsteps.@
` The sound of dry footsteps reaches my ears.\

` I jump back for no apparent reason.\

` A blade runs through the darkness.@
` Not being able to get away fully, my glasses are grazed by it.@
` They fall to the ground with a clatter.\
`"Who---"@
` The instant I start to say "are you?",
` The clouds part for a brief moment and the dark figure is illuminated.\

` Two slivers of light shoot towards each other.@

` I can't, think calmly.@
` The fact that I'm being attacked causes my mind to panic.\

` Clang!@ Clang!@ Sparks fly from our clashing knives and scatter into the darkness.@
`"Kk---"@
` I still can't calm down.@
` It's not because I'm being attacked.@
br
` Clang---.@
` I swing my knife to cancel out the one attacking me from every angle.\

`"Why----"@
` What's surprising is that,
` my body is completely stopping all the attacks in this darkness without a pause.\

`"My body is moving by itself---?"@
` No, that's not it.@
` All my arms are doing,
` is seeking out the lines and points that I can see in the darkness with my glasses off.@
br
` That's all I can see, so I swing my knife through the dark air after those lines.@
` As a result, the bandaged man's knife is simply stopping mine.@
` In other words,
` It's not that I'm defending myself, but he's defending himself from me.\
br
` ----I can win……!@
br
` I don't know who he is, but there's no doubt.@
` I'm overwhelming him.@
` My blood rages forth from my advantage.@
` I'll win.@ I'm, stronger than him.@
` Because I'm stronger.@ Because he's trying to kill me, aren't I just returning the favor----!?\

` Clang.@ Clang.@
` The sound of ringing metal echoes in the air and I force him back towards the mansion wall.\

` There.@
` My eyes fixate on the "line" on his chest and I thrust my knife forward.@

` Because, where he's aiming are the "lines" on my body.@
br
` So I know where he is aiming at and I understand more than anyone that having them cut would mean instant death, so I have to defend it.\

` No, wait.@

` His voice grates awfully.@
` At the same time---the three spears alight like candles and engulf him in flames.@

`"AAAAAaAAAaaaaAaAAAh!"@

` An anguished voice in the whirlpool of flames.@
` In the darkness, that scene seems less cruel, and almost beautiful.\

br
`"AAAAAAAAAAH!"@

` The bandaged man---no, the bandages are burned already, his skin is showing.@
` Wrapped in the flames, the man stares at me.@
` His blood-shot eyes filled only with murder.@
` His black eyes like a weapon bent on cursing Tohno Shiki.\

`"-----Wha…"@
` Stunned, I can only watch.@
` He runs off into the distance, still engulfed in flames.\

` Clenched in her hand, large, nail-like swords.@
` Emotionless, pale eyes.@ Blue, sky-blue eyes.@
`"…… Sen…… pai?"@
` Under the moonlight, I can only make out the silhouette.@
` But, she seems to resemble Senpai.\
