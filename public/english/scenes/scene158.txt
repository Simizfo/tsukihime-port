` …… I go up the residential hill and arrive at the outskirts of the mansion.@
` It's around two in the morning.@
` As expected, I'm totally assailed by sleepiness.\

`"…… I wonder if she's going to be okay."@
` I'm concerned about how she seemed when we parted.@
` It seemed like it wasn't pain from her wound, but---\
`"Hm…… crap, the front gate is locked."@
` It's only natural, but it's still locked.@
br
` …… If I climb over the wall like yesterday, alarms will probably go off.@
`"…… Dang…… does this mansion have a rear entrance or something?"\

` …… I walk around the mansion perimeter.@
` Anyway, there is something like a rear entrance, but it's locked so I can't get in.@
` It's probably not possible to force my way through to the garden.\

`"…… Dang.@ If this keeps up I'll have to spend the night out here……"@
` I want to avoid that if possible.@
` People don't really go by the mansion, so after the sun sets it's just a deep darkness around here.@
` Walking around during these hours sends chills down my spine.\

`"Hm?"@
br
` What is that?@
` It feels like there's someone lurking in the shadows not illuminated by the streetlights.\

` ---Thu,mp.@
br
` My heart stops my breath.@
` My blood rushes through my body, this sensation---\

br
` Certainly, there's someone standing there.@
` The figure gets closer and closer.\

br
` Footsteps.@
br
` The sound of dry footsteps reaches my ears.\

br
` ----Thu, mp.@
br
` I have a bad feeling about this.@
` Chills race up my spine.\

`"----"@
` The figure draws near.@
` Suddenly----the streetlights shatter loudly.@

` The moon is hidden by the clouds.@
` The whole world instantly turns to darkness.@
br
`"!"@
br
` ----Thump………!@

` My heartbeat skips, as if warning me of death.@
` Perhaps I was tired after having walked the perimeter of the mansion for so long.@
` My body gave an all-too-sluggish reaction as I tried to leap backwards.\

` A knife running through the dark.@
` The sound of the flesh over my heart being sliced.@

`"Ah----"@
` An eerie figure wrapped entirely in bandages.@
` That's… the last thing I see.\
