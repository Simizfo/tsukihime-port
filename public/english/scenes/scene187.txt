`"--Shiki, if you hesitate you'll die.@ They are no longer alive.@ Once they have their blood sucked by a vampire and become The Dead, they can no longer return--they are just dolls used by the vampire.@ There's no sin in killing them."@

`"Wait.@ What do you mean?"@

`"Ah----"@

` From behind, like a piggy-back stance.@
` The Dead bites on my neck.@
` Not to suck my blood or anything like that.@
