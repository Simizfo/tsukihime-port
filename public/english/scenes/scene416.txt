` Recalling the dream, I check both my hands.@
` There isn't any blood on my hands.@
` Well, of course.@
` That was just a dream, so I wasn't covered in blood, nor did I suck any blood.\

br
br
` ---But.@
`   Yesterday morning, what did I do?@
`   Didn't I take my hands drenched in red paint,
!w750
`   while trying not to let anyone see them,
!w750
`   and wash them clean?\

br
` ----You and I are the same, Shiki-kun.@
br
`    That's what she said.@
br
`   …… I can't remember that well.@
`   Tohno Shiki was bit by her.@
br
`   …… I can't remember that well.@
`   If there is a habit of drinking blood.@
br
`   …… I can't think well.@
`   It spreads by being bitten.\


`"------No……!!"@
` I sweep away the dark passions in my brain.@
` But that dream doesn't disappear.@
` There was a me that killed someone.@
` There's the problem.@
` Even though it's in my dreams, I killed someone and didn't feel any guilt.@
` All I did was kill naturally, and watch.\

` That's abnormal.@
` Inside my dreams, I wasn't sane.@
` That is different from this me right now.@
` But, that's a dream that Tohno Shiki saw.@
` So---even that insane Tohno Shiki has to be me.\

`"-----No."@
` …… And, the Akiha that came to punish me.@
` It might be a dream.@
` But for some reason, I feel like it's a glimpse of the future, and start to get nauseous.@

` Hisui says this with a pained expression.@
`"Eh----"@
` I think this is the first time I've seen her show emotion like this.@
` …… No, that's not true.@
` If I recall in detail, Hisui just looks expressionless, but you can see her emotions if you study her face.@
` I think she shows her feelings too much, so that when I compare her to that girl standing by the window, I feel a big contradiction.\

`"…… I see.@ Thank goodness it was nothing too bad."@
`"Yes.@ Maybe you should go see her?@ She probably wouldn't want you to see her when she just woke up, so she'll probably throw a pillow at you."@

`"Hisui-chan said she could not possibly see you today, so she locked herself up in her room.@

`"Well no, but it isn't a good story to talk about.@
` Don't you remember, Shiki-san?@ About Makihisa-sama's manic depression?"@
`"Manic depression……?"@
` Manic depression means that someone changes mood all of a sudden, from extreme happiness to utter despair, and vice versa.\

`"…… Like I said, this is after you left, Shiki-san.@
` Day by day, Makihisa-sama's manic depression worsened.@ It was so bad it was more like having two different personalities rather than having manic depression.@
