` Senpai can't be mad at anything else other than the incident this morning.@
` …… Senpai didn't seem angry this morning, but if she is angry, then I probably shouldn't go meet her.\

`"…… Yeah, maybe I should just go to the cafeteria today."@
`"Yeah, do that.@ C'mon, hurry up.@ There's only enough space for half the people using the cafeteria."@

` I sit next to Arihiko and eat my lunch.@
` My school's cafeteria has a television, and for better or worse for our education, they play back the morning news they recorded this morning.@

`"What a dangerous world we live in.@ Indiscriminate serial killers, drunken people stabbing people.@ A man can't even feel safe playing around at night anymore."@
` Arihiko seems like he is seriously watching the news.\

`"…… Well, certainly it is dangerous.@ But at least those serial killings won't happen anymore, so things should be like usual."@
`"Oh really?@ Did they catch the serial killer?"@
`"No, they haven't caught him…"@

` ---But Nrvnqsr is no longer in this world.@

` So the stupid title of the modern day vampire killings shouldn't be showing up in the news anymore and there will be no more of those meaningless killings.\

`"Anyway, those terrible incidents won't happen anymore; There won't be any more victims, and the streets will be back to normal."@
`"Hmmmh, I didn't know.@ I guess I should watch the news more often."@
` Making a strained face, Arihiko earnestly stares at the news.\
