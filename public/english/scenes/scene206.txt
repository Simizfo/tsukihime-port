`"Apply myself to my studies…?"@
` She's quite ceremonious about trivial things in an old fashioned kind of way… I guess it's because she's been disciplined under our old man for the last eight years.@
`"…… Well, I'd have gone to school even if she hadn't said anything."\

` I scratch my cheek.@
` There was something about Akiha's face as she left… because of it, I paid no attention at all to her various admonishings this morning.@
`"Of course---"@
` I clap my hands together.@
` For some reason, Akiha's face just then seemed to resemble her face from long ago---\

`"Shiki-sama, have you enough time?"@
`"Yeah, it should only be twenty minutes to school if I run.@ It's only seven-thirty, so I should be fine even if I take the long way."@
` Seeming satisfied with this answer, Hisui bows her head in assent.\

`"Then, allow me to see you out."@
`"Eh?@ Ah, yeah… thank you."@
` …… I still feel terribly awkward having my own servant.\

`"Oh, Shiki-san!@ Please wait just a moment!"@

`"Huh?@ Weren't you with Akiha?"@
`"Lady Akiha goes to school by car.@ Since I had something to give to you this morning, I stayed behind."@
`"Something to give me?"@
`"Yes.@ This came from the Arima family yesterday."@
` Kohaku-san smiles.\

`"Eh?@ But, I have all my luggage already.@ The things I used while I was at the Arimas' house all belonged to them, so all I've got are my own clothes…"@
`"Really?@ But this was sent here, nonetheless…"@
` Kohaku-san hands me a thin wooden box, perhaps twenty centimeters long.@
` It's not heavy at all.\

`"…… Kohaku-san, I've never seen this before."@
`"Well… apparently it was left to you by your departed father.@ It was to be given to you in the will."@
`"…… By my old man?"@
` …… I can't feel anything about that.@
` What's the old man who expelled me from this mansion eight years ago doing leaving me things?\

`"Oh well.@ Kohaku-san, please take it to my room for me."@

` Kohaku-san is staring intently at the wooden box.@

` No, she is a child.\

`"…… I get it.@ You want to know what's inside, right?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, not at all.@ I merely wondered for a moment."@
` …… Like I said, you do wonder what's inside.@
`"Alright, let's open it.@ One, two… three!"@
` With a dry sound, the wooden box opens.@
` Inside, there is----a ten-centimeter bar of thin iron.\

`"…… It's… an iron bar."@
` Undecorated and worn, it has finger marks all over it.@
` …… The old man must have really hated me to leave me a piece of junk like this.\

`"No, Shiki-san.@ It's a fruit knife."@
` Kohaku-san takes the iron bar out of the box.@
`"See, isn't it one of those folding knifes?@ One, two… three!"@
` With the sound of sliding metal, a ten-centimeter blade pops out from the bar.@
` …… I see, it certainly is a knife.\

`"It's old, but it seems pretty solid.@ The year and the era it was made in is written on the back."@
` Kohaku-san replaces the blade, and hands over the knife.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Certainly, there's a number written on the grip.@
` The character "seven", and under it, the character "night".\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_nowaitdisp

`"Nee-san, there is no era by that name.@ It just says 'Nanatsu-yoru'."@
`"Ah!"@
` I turn around in surprise.@
` Hisui, who had been silent until now, was looking at the knife over my shoulders.\

`"Y, you surprised me… Hisui, you should say something.@ You don't have to look over my shoulder like that, you know.@ If you want to see it, I'll show it to you."@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Ah----"@

` Hisui's cheeks become faintly red.\

`"P-please excuse me.@ Um---That knife was so beautiful that I could not help myself."@
`"Beautiful?@ You really think it's beautiful?@ It looks kind of beat up to me."@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---Not at all.@ The tempering of the blade is masterful.@ I think it is a knife with its own proper history."@
`"Really?@ It looks to me like a piece of junk…"\

` But since Hisui seems so convinced, I begin to feel the same thing.@
` …… Hmmm.@ In its own way, I guess it's not such a bad inheritance.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02.jpg",%type_nowaitdisp
`"'Seven nights'…?@ Maybe that's the name of this fruit knife?"@
`"Maybe… though, I can't imagine him naming a knife like that."@
` Whatever the case may be, it's obvious that it's an antique.@
`"Well, in any case, I believe in taking what's given to me."@

` I replace the blade, and put the knife in my trouser pocket.\

`"Shiki-sama, have you enough time…?"@
`"Ah!@ I have to get going.@ Well, Kohaku-san, thanks for the delivery."@

`"…… Hisui.@ You're seeing me off?"@
` Hisui nods wordlessly.\

`"Shiki-sama?@ What time shall we expect your return?"@
` It seems Hisui will continue to use "-sama" to the bitter end.@
` Well, if I take time to argue it now, I'll be late for school.@ I'll complain about the honorific later.\

`"Shiki-sama?"@
`"Ah, yeah.@ Uh… probably around four o'clock, I think.@ I don't do any club activities."@
` When I don't hang out with Arihiko, I usually get back pretty early in the evening.@
` Hisui bows deeply at my random estimate.\

`"I understand.@ Please take care on the way."@
` …… I'm not sure what to take care about, but she's probably just worried about my health.@
`"Yeah, thanks.@ You too, Hisui."@
` I return the goodwill with good intentions.@
` With an energetic wave of the hand at Hisui, I leave the gates of the mansion behind.\
