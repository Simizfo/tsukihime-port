` Thanks for waiting!@
` Time for Ciel-sensei's What & Why corner.@
` Due to popular demand, here is a supplementary lesson (number one)!\

` Oh my, Tohno-kun has gotten really serious.@
` That's a no-no.@ Even though Akiha-san has turned on her invincible mode, you shouldn't try to kill her.@
` When it comes to killing, you are by far the expert.@
` You have some leeway, so you should just observe Akiha-san for now.\

` Well, we'll end this lesson now.@
` The conclusion of Tsukihime is near.@ Do your best so you don't have to receive any more supplementary lessons.\
