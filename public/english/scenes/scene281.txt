`"…… Um, Tohno-kun.@ How can you say that?@
` I will admit that you have very good athletic abilities.@ Even though you have a weak constitution, your body itself is excellent."@
` Slumping her shoulders, Senpai says something very surprising.@
`"…… R, really?"@
` The tension seems to disappear, and I blurt that out in response.\

`"Yes.@ Tohno-kun, you got naked when you spent the night at my house.@ I saw you then.@ Not flabbiness, but tight muscles.@
` You were far away, but I thought your body was very well-formed."@
`"…… Naked-----But I, didn't get naked."@
`"Did you forget?@ Tohno-kun, did you not change before you entered the bath?"@
` Ah, that's right.@
` Certainly I did take off my clothes and had her wash them for me---\

`"Senpai, I didn't know you were someone who likes to peek at people who are changing."@
