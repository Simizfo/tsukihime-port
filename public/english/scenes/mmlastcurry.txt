` The instant I tried to run forward, Senpai's movement changed drastically.@
` In an instant, with a speed that makes her seem to have literally disappeared, she swings her weapon horizontally.\

` Her whole body is below my knee-height, and explodes upward from there.@
br
` A thud.@
br
` From right beneath me, her bayonet accurately shoots directly for my throat.\
