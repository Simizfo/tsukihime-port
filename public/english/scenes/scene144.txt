` Back then, the whole mansion was like a giant playground.@

` The garden, a deep forest.@
` The house, a tall castle.@
br
` We played in our own little world, which would take days to explore.\

` Every day was fun.@
` No one thought about ever growing up,
` and we believed that days and nights would always be the same.@
br
` It was just a childhood spent playing like puppies.@
` We got along wonderfully, and were the best of playmates.\

` Whenever I turned back, Akiha would be there, waving her hands and hiding shyly.@
` Yes, always the same.\

` After taking a few deep breaths, I manage to calm down.@
`"Why did I---so early…"@
` See those lines so clearly this early in the morning?@
` It's difficult to see the lines of death in buildings.@
` It's usually hard to see them, and seeing them so clearly like I just did now is rare.@
`"…………"@
` What's more, I even saw those "points".@
` I think my headache is getting worse too.\

` Sensei said these eyes would attract things that weren't good.@
` I think Arcueid and these vampires are certainly not good.@
` So, maybe it's all affecting my eyes and making them stronger.@
`"----Can't be."@
` I'm probably just tired.\
