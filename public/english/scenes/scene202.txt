` …… Akiha isn't the only person I haven't seen since then.@
` I can't remember all the details because it's been eight years, but there were other children at the mansion around the same age as me.\

` I don't remember their names, but there were two girls who were twins.@
` The old man once said that they didn't have any relatives, so he took them to work as servants.@
`"…… That's weird.@ We played together so often when we were small, but I can't remember their names."@
` I close my eyes and cast my mind back.\

` I should be able to remember.@
` She was a girl who was always cheerful, so cheerful that you would become cheerful just by looking at her.@
` A girl with a carefree personality who was loved by everyone at the mansion.@
` Because she was close to my age, I got along very well with her, and it seemed like every day we would run around the garden together.@
`"Let's play together, Shiki-chan."@
` She would say, and I could remember her taking me out of my room after I secluded myself inside.\

` She would often laugh and take shy Akiha's hand, trying to make her play with us.@
` Maybe she was older than the both of us.@
` She would guide me and Akiha to play together, but once we started playing, she would just watch over us.@
` Even Akiha's tutor, the harsh butler, would say "I don't mind, as long as ****** is with you guys", and let Akiha out to play.\

` But I'm much more concerned about the other girl.\

` …… I don't know what kind of girl she was or why she was always like that.@
` From the second floor,
` there was always a girl looking down at us every time I turned to look at the mansion while we were playing in the garden.\
` She was the twin of that cheerful girl, but she would always gaze at us expressionlessly.@
` That girl would never try to leave the house.@
` All she would do was watch us with those cold eyes.@
` …… Was it because it bothered me so much that I thought she seemed so lonely?@ Most of the memories I have about the Tohno mansion are only about her.\

`"I wonder if those girls are still at the mansion……"@
` While I think about that, I take a white ribbon out of my bag.@
` An old white ribbon that the girls gave me at the very end.\

` ---Eight years ago.@
` After I was involved in the accident.@
` The day I was entrusted to the Arima family.@
br
` Right before I was to leave the mansion, the girl gave me this for some reason.@
br
` …… I'm just lending it to you, so be sure to return it.@
` Saying something along those lines, she ran off.\
` A promise made under a large tree.@
br
` The weather was beautiful that day.@ Looking up, there was a high, high blue sky I could just lose myself in.@
` It was my last memory of when I left the Tohno mansion, eight years ago.\

` *sigh*@
` I put the ribbon back in my bag.@
` "But it's been eight years, after all……"@
` Not only do I not know if they are still at the mansion, I can't even remember their names.@
`"…… Even so, this ribbon is precious to me……"@
` The time when my father had disinherited me.@
` Rather than being saddened over having been discarded by him, I felt a warmness inside when I thought she was waiting for me to return the ribbon.@
` That's why I want to keep the promise, as long as I still remember it.@
` I agreed to return to the mansion because Akiha is now there all by herself.@
` I left her there for eight years, pushing all responsibility onto her while I selfishly lived freely.\
` …… But there is something else.@ I really think I decided to return because of that promise.@
` The white ribbon.@
` …… Because of that promise made to the only one who said she would be waiting for me.\
