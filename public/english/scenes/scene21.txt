` I arrive in class earlier than usual.@
` "Phew." I walk to my desk next to the window.@
br
`"Good morning, Tohno-kun."@
` An unfamiliar voice greets me.@
`"---Eh?"@
` I turn around, confused.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\stk_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Tohno-kun, the teacher was looking for you.@ He said he wanted to talk to you about your house."\

`"Hmm… My home?@ Must be about me moving."@
` …… I should have finished the formalities yesterday.@ Perhaps there's something I forgot to do.@
`"-----"@
` The girl doesn't move, but stands there looking at me.@
`"Uh… Good morning, Yumizuka."@
`"Yeah.@ Good morning, Tohno-kun.@ Looks like you remember my name."@
br
` Sighing with relief, Yumizuka Satsuki gives a faint smile.\

`"I can remember the names of my own classmates, you know?@ It's just that I haven't spoken to you much."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\stk_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yeah.@ I was a little nervous about talking to you."@
` Yumizuka smiles again.@
` She seems happy about something.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


`"……"@
` Yumizuka continues to stare at me as if she wants to say something else.@
` …… To be honest, I don't know her that well.@ Although we're in the same class, I can count the times we've spoken.\

` But Yumizuka Satsuki is the center of attention.@
` She's often the topic of conversation among the boys, and there aren't any bad rumors about her among the girls.@ In short, she's your typical class idol.@
br
` Naturally, she's always surrounded by a crowd.@ She's the complete opposite of a loner like me.@
` While I might be able to remember the name 'Yumizuka Satsuki', there's no reason for her to remember the name 'Tohno Shiki'.@ It seems like some bothersome coincidences are at work today.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\stk_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Tohno-kun.@ Um… Can I ask you a question?"@
`"If I can answer, you can ask as many as you want."@
`"Um… um… Sorry if it's something personal, but… you said you're moving… Are you going to move somewhere far away?"@
` Her voice trails off, as if it's hard for her to ask.@
` She clasps her hands to stop fidgeting.\

`"I know it's sudden, but… will you be transferring somewhere?"@
`"Ah, no, no.@ I'm changing my residence, but not my school.@ My new house is still in this town anyway, so it's no big deal."@
`"Oh… that's good."@
` Yumizuka sighs with relief.@
`"…?"@
` How odd.@ Why would something like me moving cause that kind of reaction?\

`"But… are you going to leave the Arimas?"@
`"Yeah.@ I enjoyed living with them, but I can't leech off them forever."@
br
` …… Huh?@
` How does Yumizuka know that?@ No one at this school should know I was living with the Arimas, except for a certain guy…\

`"Wassup, Tohno!"@
` A carefree loud voice rings out from the classroom doorway.@
` As if on cue, the guy who's been my friend since middle school appears.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Hey, if it isn't Yumizuka!@ It's not often I see you talkin' to Tohno."@
`"…… Morning, Inui-kun." Yumizuka looks away with an unenthusiastic reply.@
` …… I guess she isn't the type who'd respond well to a guy like him.\

`"Tohno's picking up chicks?@ What the hell is going on?@ I thought you weren't interested in 'em?"@
` Arihiko exclaims his joke loudly.@
`"You moron, stop spreading lies.@ I'm a normal guy!@ Of course I'm interested in girls."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Is that right?@ Good for you man!@ Still, these days, girls find it more amusing if you have a weird sex drive instead.@ But they'll only find it amusing and it won't go any farther!"@
` His bottomless, cheerful laughter echoes throughout the morning classroom.\


` …… I let out another sigh.@
` I once again wonder, like I have many times before, how I ended up knowing this person.@
br
` His hair dyed orange, ears pierced.@
` His vicious glare that shouts he will pick a fight with anyone, any time, and his wearing of rebellious clothes.@
` Inui Arihiko is the only free-spirited outlaw in our university-oriented high school.\

`"Do you have to be so loud this early in the morning?@ I'm depressed about all sorts of stuff, so stay away from me today, okay?"@
` I wave my hands to shoo him away.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Depressed?@ What's wrong, man?@ Is it 'that' time of the month?"@
`"…… Wait, I take that back.@ Rather than just for today, stay away from me for the rest of my life.@ My depression will only get worse with you around."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


` Ignoring Arihiko, I head back to my own desk.@
` Dropping my bag and taking a seat, I stretch my back.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey, you can't just ignore other people like that, Tohno.@ You're gonna hurt people with that careless attitude of yours."@
`"Oh, that's news to me.@ Isn't there some way I can kill them instead?@ If you can tell me how, I'll repay you by trying it out on you."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"…… That's cold, man.@ Aren't you just a little nastier than usual this morning?"@
`"Didn't I tell you I'm depressed?@ Other people aside, I'm certainly not showing any kindness to you."\

` Arihiko sighs.@
`"…… Why are you only mean to me, Tohno?@ You're like a saint to everyone else.@ It's not fair."@
`"What, you just figured that out?@ The world's unfair."@
`"…… You really are only mean to me."@
br
` Arihiko gives another exaggerated sigh.@
` I didn't try particularly hard to be cold to Arihiko.@ That's just the kind of relationship we have.\

`"So, Arihiko, what's a chronically-late night owl who never shows up until second period doing here in homeroom?@ It's a little… no, it's very odd."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Haha… I was thinking that too.@ I guess being at school on time isn't just for when I happen to wake up early."@
`"…… Well, I won't comment on your hobbies, but what I'm asking is why you woke up early."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Why I woke up early?@ Uhh… I guess it's because I can't stay out late since all that fuss started, so I actually go to sleep at night now.@
` You've heard the stories about that serial killer, haven't you?"\

`"…… I see.@ Come to think of it, I did hear something like that."@
` I feel a tinge of regret at needing Arihiko to remind me.@
` For the past two or three days I had been debating whether or not to return to the Tohno household, so I completely lost touch with the news.\

`"What was that again?@ They've given it some really nasty name, like the 'Freakish Serial Killings' or something."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"There's more to it.@ So far, all the victims have been young girls.@ The eighth victim was only two days ago!@ And to top it all off, they were all… wait, what happened to them again?"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Arihiko tilts his head in contemplation.@
`"……"@
` I'm an idiot for asking him.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yeah, I remember now!@ All the victims were cut up into pieces and arranged in a pattern or something!"@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\stk_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"…… No, Inui-kun.@ Everyone who was killed lost a lot of blood."@
`"Oh yeah, that was it.@ They said it's some kind of modern day vampire or something."@
`"Hmph.@ You sure know a lot about this, Yumizuka-san."@
`"Not really.@ It's happening in this town, so it's in the news.@ You'd remember it even if you didn't want to."@
` …… I see.@
` I thought it was happening in a neighboring town… but I guess it moved down here.\

`"Well, anyway, that's what happened.@ Even I wouldn't be going on the streets at night with a killer walkin' around.@ That's why I've been waking up at seven lately."@
`"…… What, that's it?@ Having a good reason doesn't make a good story.@ Where's the fun in that?"@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Man, you're cold.@ What, did you collapse from anemia already this morning?"@
`"I'm alright, thanks for asking.@ If I was anemic twenty-four hours a day, I'd be dead by now."@
`"Yeah, you're right.@ If you say you're okay, then I guess you're okay."\

` Second period is over.@
` Our homeroom teacher, who's also our math teacher, calls out to me as he leaves.@
`"Tohno, your documents are missing some details.@ Please go visit the office."@
` It shouldn't take long, so I'll head to the office before the third period starts.@
` The office is on the first floor.@
` The second-year classroom is on the third floor, but I could make it back before third period starts if I run.\

` …!?@
` The impact floors me with a thud!@ My head hits something, and the world swims before my eyes.\

`"Ooow… Owowow…"@
` I hear a voice nearby.@ It's a woman's voice I've never heard before.@
` It looks like I ran into someone.@
`"I'm sorry, are you alright?" I still can't see my surroundings too well, but I apologize to the person I hit.\

`"Yes, I'm alright… How about you?@ Are you okay?"@
` There's no trace of accusation in that gentle voice.@
` I don't know who she is, but it seems like she's worried about me.@
`"Ah… Yeah, I'm also okay."@
` I shake my head and stand up.@

`"I am so sorry.@ I was not paying attention to where I was going.@ Your forehead must really hurt, right?" The female student gazes apologetically at my face.@
` From the formal way she spoke, I assumed she was a first-year, but from the color of her ribbon, I can see she's a third-year… in other words, my senpai.@
`"No, it's fine, really.@ I'm the one at fault.@ I'm sorry for bumping into you, Senpai."@
` I lower my head in a bow.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, come to think of it, you're right.@ You shouldn't be running down the hallways, you know.@ There are people like me spaced out while looking down at the courtyard."@
`"Yes, I'll be more careful… Are you alright, Senpai?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, I only fell.@ It's because you ran into the wall while trying to avoid hitting me, Tohno-kun."@
`"Really?@ No wonder I'm seeing stars."@
` I'm lucky to get off with just a bump after running into a wall at that speed.\

`"Sorry about that, but spacing out in the hallway is also dangerous, Senpai."@

` If she's this beautiful, the male students would be talking about a "third-year beauty wearing glasses".\

`"Um… I'm going now.@ You should go back to your classroom too, Senpai.@
` Ah, if you're in any pain, please come to my classroom.@ I'm Tohno from Second Year, Third Class.@ I'll take responsibility."@
` She nods.@
` …… Even though she's older than me, it's like dealing with someone younger.\

`"Alright.@ If anything happens, I'll come to your classroom at lunchtime.@ Remember, Shiki-kun, you mustn't run in the hallways."@
