` The door opens with a creak.@
` With a heavy body and dulled mind, I make it back to the mansion.@
` My footsteps drag behind me.@
` The moonlight illuminates my figure, making it look like an exhausted ghost.\

`"-----------"@
` …… My left arm hurts where Yumizuka wounded me.@
` The bleeding has stopped, and the gradual lessening of the pain tells me it couldn't have been too deep.\
`"-----------"@
` I reach the stairs.@
` I don't even care about treating my wounds.@
` Right now, I just want to stumble back to my room and sleep like a rock----\

` I wake from a long sleep.@
` The sunshine from the window looks closer to mid-day than morning.@
` It must be because of how late I got back last night.@
` It seems I've overslept.\

`"……………"@
` Dragging myself up from bed, I look down at my hand.@
` ----The sensation of how I stabbed Yumizuka remains.@
` Two nights ago.@
` When I met Yumizuka and saw that hideous dream.@
`"…… If only yesterday…… was just a dream."@
` But wishing it won't make it so.@
` I've no clue why or how Yumizuka became a vampire, and I couldn't do anything to help her.\

` ---No.@
` Once Yumizuka had become like that, there was probably no way for anyone to help her.@
` She was already dead.@
` All I did was return that corpse somehow moving about as if it were a living thing back to being a dead body.@ That's the only way I can think of it.@

` But, still---

`"Please excuse me, Shiki-sama."@
` With that voice I have become accustomed to, Hisui enters the room.\

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama.@ How are you feeling today?"@
`"Hm…… ah, I slept well, so I don't feel bad at all."@
`"Is that so?@ Hearing that makes me feel very relieved."@
` …… Even though she says that, I don't see her even relax her shoulders, or give any other indication of it.\

`"……………"@
` But, I feel relieved as well.@
` Because of what happened last night, the long night is over.@ Because I don't have to enter that unnatural world any longer, my heart can relax.@
`"…… Thanks, Hisui.@ You've always come to check up on me from early in the morning, right?@ Your concern means a lot to me."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----Not at all.@ It is my duty to be concerned with your welfare."@
` There is a hint of happiness in Hisui's expression.\

` …… Moreover, I feel like I've been somewhat rescued.@
` While I've been sleeping in bed like this, Hisui came as always to wake me up.@
` With just that trivial thing, I honestly feel like I have returned to my normal life.\

`"Um…… Shiki-sama, this is somewhat difficult for me to say, but… can I?"@
`"……?@ Difficult to say?@ If it's about me sleeping in till noon, I really can't do anything but apologize."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, that is not what I meant, but it is perhaps related to when you went to sleep."@
` Hisui fidgets with her fingers as she struggles to come up with the right words.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Um, I did not say anything, but Akiha-sama found out about last night."@
`"Eh…… about last night…… what?"@
`"I mean when you left late last night, Shiki-sama."@
`"Oh----"@
` I unconsciously turn my eyes away from her.@
` I thought I'd managed to slip away undetected, but I should have known Hisui would still find out.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki-sama, your return late at night has gained the attention of Akiha-sama, so I believe you will be asked to explain yourself sooner or later.@
` She is in the sitting room and may be angry, so please be prepared."@
`"……… I see.@ Oh well, I can't complain, since it was me that went out past curfew."\

`"About that, will it be occurring again?@ I cannot stop you, but if you continue doing such things, I must tell Akiha-sama."@
`"----No, nothing like last night will happen again.@ Everything…… has ended last night…… There won't be any phone calls anymore."\

` ---Yes.@ It really has ended.@
` With these words, it truly is over.@
` Yumizuka Satsuki is no more.@
` The vampire skulking the streets has vanished.@ I, with my own hands, sent away a classmate who said she liked me, for all eternity.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"……………………"@
` Hisui looks at me with a painful expression on her face.@
` …… Geez, if Hisui is making that sort of face, then I must look terrible right now.@
`"---Well, I should get up sooner or later.@ Hisui, is Akiha still here?@ She's an awfully busy person, so does she have a routine on her day off?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, she does have plans during her day off, but today she is still in the mansion."@
`"………?"@
` She has plans, but she's still here……?\

`"I don't quite get it, but…… well, I'll go and get changed, so please head to the sitting room before me."@
`"Yes.@ Well then, please excuse me."@

` As usual, Hisui walks away without a sound.@

` ---But, I forgot something really important.@

`"Hisui."\

`"Yes?@ What is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Yeah, I forgot to say something.@ Thanks for coming to wake me up.@ It's a little late, but good morning, Hisui."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---Yes.@ Please have a nice day, Shiki-sama."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` Well then.@
` I should hurry up and change, and head to the sitting room.\
