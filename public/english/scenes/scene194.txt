` I wake up to the sound of Hisui's voice.@
` Since then----after returning to the mansion, I must have made my way to my room somehow and slept.\

`"Shiki-sama, are you not feeling well?"@
`"----No, I'm fine."@
` Answering, I sit up in bed.@
br
` …… I'm almost amazed at myself.@
` I don't even feel like talking, but my body tries to start my day as always.\

`"Breakfast?@ I'll be down soon."@

`"……… Yes.@ I will be waiting."@
` Looking as if she still wants to say something, Hisui leaves the room.@
` I change my clothes and head to the sitting room.\

` Akiha and Kohaku are there.@
`"Morning."@
` Giving my usual greeting, I go to the dining room.@
` I eat breakfast and return to the sitting room.@
` I sit on the sofa and stare at the clock.\

`"…… Nii-san?@ Um, you know you have school today, right?"@
`"Hm----?@ Yeah, that's right.@ I guess I should go to school."@
` I forgot.@
` I didn't feel like doing anything, and I thought I would keep living like this empty shell.\

`"…… I do have my life as Tohno Shiki.@ If I don't have anything to do, it won't hurt to go to school."@
`"Nii-san……?"@
` Akiha looks at me uneasily.@

` …… Speaking is just a pain.@

` Without saying anything, I go to school.\

` Time passes by uneventfully.@
` I emptily attend my lessons.@
` The sound of the chalk.@
` I mindlessly write down what's written on the board into my notes.@
br
` I look out the window into the rear courtyard.@
` Of course there's no one there.\

`"------"@
` ----What am I doing?@
` Just calmly attending my lessons like this.@
` Not searching for her and just returning to my normal life.\

`"------"@
` But, there's no way for me to search for Arcueid.@
` Since she left on her own, there's probably no possibility of me finding her.@
br
` That's why…
` I've really lost Arcueid---.\

br
` *snap*@
br
`"…………"@
` A sound comes from above my desk.@
` …… Ah, it's nothing.@
` I was just gripping my mechanical pencil so hard that I snapped another one.\

` Classes end.@
` In the commotion of the classroom, I still remain seated.@
br
`"Tohno, can you come here for a moment?"@
` My math teacher speaks up from the podium.@
`"----Yes, what is it?"@
` I respond and walk towards him.\

`"Tohno, hasn't your recent behavior been a little wild?@ I have received information that you have been going out late at night.@ Does it ring a bell?"@
`"…… Yes.@ These past few days, I had things to do in town at night."@
`"----I see."@
` My math teacher----well, my homeroom teacher as well----looks a bit concerned, then looks a little sorry.\

`"I know you're not the kind of student to goof off at night, but there have been concerns voiced by the faculty.@ It appears the head of the student council would like to speak to you.@
` Because of that, please go to the student council room after school.@ Just consider yourself unlucky and bear with it."@
` Saying goodbye, he leaves the classroom.\

` After school.@
` I stop by the student council room, but the teacher isn't there.@
` …… Now that I remember, that teacher is also an adviser to the gymnastics team.@
` He probably won't come until practice is over.\

`"------"@
` I sit in my chair and wait faithfully.@
`"………… Kk."@
` I bite my lip.@
` I know this isn't the time to be doing this.@
` I know, but there's nothing I can do.\

` Outside the window, the sunset paints the sky vermillion.@
` I can hear the voices of club members practicing outside and the students talking while going home.@
` Within that, this classroom is the only quiet place.\

` …… This makes me angry.@
` Why am I here?@
` I can't do anything.@
` I'm angry at my powerlessness.@
` However, I have no way to solve this myself, so in the end, all I can do is accept everything I'm told emptily.\

`"…… What am I doing?"@
` There's no answer.@
` I just sit in the empty classroom listening to the sounds outside.\

` Tick.@
` The second hand of the clock sweeps by, telling me it's now seven at night.@
` No one comes by.@
` The school closes at six and all the teachers leave at six-thirty, so no one else remains on the school grounds.\

`"…… I guess I'm forgotten."@
` I get up from my chair.@
` After pondering matters so long, my head starts to clear a little.\

` I was thinking all this time.@
` About what I should do, what I should prioritize.@
` From here, I should----
