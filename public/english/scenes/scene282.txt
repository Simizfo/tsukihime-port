`"Tsss, ah…………!"@
` My body falls with a crash.@
`"Ah, ah, ah…………!"@
` My entire body is convulsing.@
` It, hurts.@
` My chest, my chest is, burning,,,,,,!\

`"----,---,aaaah………!"@
` My mind is drifting away.@
` My fingers claw at the tatami mats in pain.@
` I pull and rip at the mats.@
` But, it doesn't stop the pain.\

`"Hagh, gah, ghaaaaa……!"@
` Pain.@
br

` Pain.@
br
` Pain.@
` Such pain, is frightening.\

`"U, ugah, kuaaaa………!"@
` I can't bear it.@
` If it lasts another second,
` then, it would be better, just to die----!\

` Before that.@
` My pain disappears.@
` I don't feel pain anywhere.\
` I don't even feel heavy.@
` I don't even feel… alive.\

`"----"@
` I try to say something, but my throat doesn't move.@
!w750

` There's nothing.@
!w750
` No pain,
!w750
` no sensation,
!w750
` not even, freedom.\


`"-----!"@
` I don't know what's going on, so I try to get up.@
br
` My body doesn't even twitch.@
` It's not that I'm tied down, nor is it that my entire body is numb.@
br
` If I have to give a metaphor,
` it's like my body is already dead, but my mind is mistakenly still lingering in my body.\


`"------"@
` Of my five senses, only my sight is still alive.@
` …… the room is dark.@
` It's night outside already.@
`"---"@
` I can't move my face, so I move my eyes.\

`"---Oh?@ I thought you had completely disappeared, but you're awfully persistent, Shiki."\

` I can hear a voice I shouldn't be able to hear.@
`"----!"@
` I glance around the dark as best as I can.@
` There,
` I see something I don't know about.\

`"----"@
` Who is that?@
` I've never seen him.@ I've never seen him---but I feel like, I've known him from a long, long time ago.\

`"What's this?@ How mean of you, Shiki.@
` You've been looking for me for so long and when I come out, you don't remember me?"@
` With an amused laugh, he stares at me with blood-shot eyes.\

`"-----"@
` My mind, the only thing still working, freezes.@
` He didn't say it yet,
` But---I know he is a vampire.@
` That he is the "Serpent" Senpai and Arcueid are looking for.\

`"…… No, that's wrong.@ Certainly I am the vampire known as the Serpent of Akasha.@
` But to you, I'm not the Serpent, but rather, SHIKI, right?@

` ---Man, how cold of you.@ You make me look stupid for thinking about you all these eight years."\

` -----?@
` SHIKI?@
` Eight years?@
` What is that----?\

`"---Did you really forget Shiki?@
` …… Was the old man's hypnosis that good or---did you lose your memory after dying once?@
` Shit, either way, what a waste!@
` Do you understand!?@ These eight years, I've waited these eight years!@ I've waited for this instance where I could steal everything from you, the one who killed me!@ But what use is it now if you don't remember!?"\

`"-----"@
` What is, he saying?@
` I---killed him?\

`"That's right!@ If you've forgotten, then remember.@ The three of us were always together, right?@
` In the Tohno mansion.@ Akiha and you, and I would play in the garden together.@ Before I became like this eight years ago that day!"\

` ---I, can't remember.@
` Certainly---it seems like there was another kid with us back then.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\roa_t04a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… You can't remember?@ And we were such good friends too."@
` He grits his teeth.@
` His whole body quivers with emotion as if he was brimming with vexation.\

`"---Geez.@ Was I the only one in pain?@
` That's terrible, Shiki.@ I was always locked away by my old man, but I could always sense you.@
` Haha.@ Because I was using your 'life'.@ Even though we're not connected by blood, we're connected by our souls."\

`"That's why you---I wanted you to have a terribly gruesome end."@
` How unfortunate, he says.\

`"What I wanted to say is this, Shiki.@ I'm your brother.@ But you and Akiha seem to have heartlessly forgotten that."@
`"-----"@
` My…… Tohno Shiki's, brother………?\

`"---If you've forgotten, then there's nothing to talk about.@
` Your painful death is the goal of this body…… of Tohno SHIKI.@
` I've gone along with that this long, but it's time to lower the curtain.@
` Even for me---to have two bodies with one life is not very efficient."\

` The voice nears.@
` I'll be killed like this.@
` …… No, I say I'll die, but maybe I'm already dead.@
` My arms and legs can't move.@
` My eyes, my ears, my nose don't work.@
br
` That's why there isn't even any pain.@
` I am killed so vaguely that I don't even realize it.\
