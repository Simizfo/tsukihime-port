` ………, ………………, ……………………@
br
`"--Mor--ning?"@
` I dazedly open my eyes.@
` Sunshine pours in from the window, enveloping the room with a warm atmosphere.\
br
`"--------"@
br
` I stare down at my hands.@
` They are a little sweaty.@ My body is drenched in sweat as well, as if last night was incredibly hot.@
` What's more, I'm panting heavily.\

`"Ah--------"@
` I shake both my hands.@
`"…… I can… move……"@
` There isn't any mark left on my wrist from the ropes.@
` The bed is clean, and neither the chair Akiha was sitting on nor Kohaku-san are anywhere to be seen.\

`"H------uh?"@
br
` Akiha, and Kohaku-san……?@
br
`"Ko----Kohaku-san?"@
` I look around wildly.@
` I see--
`"……… There's… no one………"@
` Right, no one's here.@
` The bed doesn't look rumpled--and Kohaku-san who was acting like a mischievous devil isn't here.\

`"A----dream?"@
` As soon as I realize it, I heave a sigh of relief.@ I shut my eyes and catch my breath.@
` This is my room.@
` It is before seven in the morning.@
` I am the only one here, and of course Kohaku-san and Akiha are nowhere to be seen.@
`"Ha……………… a."@
` Yeah, I know.@
` I know it was a dream.@ Now that I'm calm, I know she wouldn't ever do anything like that.@
` In that instance, what happened last night was not real.\

`"Ha--ah."@
` I let out a deep breath.@
` …… All the same, I definitely still remember what happened last night.@
` I know it was a dream--but it felt too real; it makes me think it was real.\
` …… All the same, it has got to be a dream.@
` But I guess that is good in a way.\

`"But, why--"@
` Why did I see that dream?@
` …… Well, I really do think Kohaku-san is cute.@
` She seems to be the most free one here, and for some reason, whenever I see her, I feel more lively.@
` But, that's different.@
` I think of her as my family, certainly--not as a woman.\

`"------Uh."@
` All the same, I keep remembering her mischievous eyes.@
`"Damn--what the hell am I thinking?"@
` I shake my head to clear out the remnants of the dream.@
` But then,\

`"Shiki-sama."@
`"Uwaaaaaa!"@
` I flail around off my bed as if trying to escape.@
` No--in fact I was trying to escape, but it just ended up with me landing on the floor with the sheets.\

`"Hi, Hihi, Hisui…… !?@ H, how long have you been there!?"@
`"Since before you awoke, Shiki-sama."@
` She speaks with her usual lack of expression.@
` Still lying on the floor tangled in the sheets and unable to stand, I look up at Hisui's face.\

`"…… Before I… woke up……"@
br
` --Then, that means…
` Hisui saw my face when I was having that dream?@
br
` My face turns deep red.\
` Hisui just stands there, expressionless as usual, and makes no attempt to speak.\

`"Um…… did I look… strange……?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"I do not wish to describe it."@
`"Ah--h"@
` …… I knew it.@ I must've looked really weird.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"But, if you insist, Shiki-sama, I can describe as accurately as I can."@
`"…… No, you don't have to do that……"@
` My face still flushed, I speak in a fading voice.\

`"Um, Hisui-san?"@
` I give a cough to clear the silence.@
` …… Adding "san" to her name is a clear sign of my vulnerability.\



`"What is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Um…… I'm going to change, so would you mind waiting outside?"@
br
` --Or rather, I'm so embarrassed I just want her to leave.@
` But Hisui doesn't obey today of all days.\

`"Once I can confirm you are awake, I will leave the room, Shiki-sama."@
`"……!"@
` Huh?@ Is, is is is she joking!?@
` Why does she think I'm covering myself up in these sheets!?@
` It's to hide something that's still standing!\

`"I, I'm fine, so please leave.@ I can get up, and I won't go back to sleep.@ I'll change and go to the sitting room as soon as you leave."@
`"Shiki-sama--Are you hurt and unable to stand……?"@

cl c,%type_crossfade_mid

` Hisui approaches me out of worry.@
`"No, that's not it.@ I'm standing----I mean I can stand, so don't worry about it."@
` I crawl pulling my sheets like a slug, and gain some distance from her.@
` Using the bed as a barrier, I get far enough away.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Then, please excuse me.@ I will prepare your breakfast, so please come after you change."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` She has got to be suspicious, but she bows and leaves the room.\

` *sigh*@
` I was so surprised.@
` The contents of my dream were surprising enough, but knowing Hisui saw me while I was dreaming is very troubling.@
` …… Or is it my own fault for having that kind of dream about Kohaku-san?\
`"…… I guess it is my fault.@ Just what was I thinking?@ Having that kind of dream about Kohaku-san…?"@
` I give a sigh of self-loathing.@
` To feel relaxed around Kohaku-san again, I should just forget about this dream as soon as possible.\

` After calming down enough, I head to the sitting room.@
` As usual, Akiha is sitting on the sofa, elegantly sipping tea.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Good morning, Nii-san.@ You are certainly up early this morning."@
` She must be happy I woke up because she greets me with a smile.@

cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah, good morning.@ There were, well, a lot of things going on this morning."@
` As soon as I say that--I remember that cold stare from last night.@
`"Uh--"@
` This isn't good.@ I can tell my face is blushing beyond my control.@
` …… I acted foolishly in front of Akiha.@
` Akiha, watching it all.\

`"Nii-san--?"@
` A brief clamor.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What's wrong?@ Your face is red, do you have a fever?"@
`"-----!"@
` Rushing over to me, she looks up at me from below.@
` So, if you stare at me that seriously, I---\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` Akiha sighs.@ "You do seem to have a fever.@ Kohaku, come quickly.@ Nii-san doesn't seem to be well."@
` Akiha calls out to the dining room.@
`"Ko---Kohaku-san?@ That's bad."@
` If I see Kohaku-san now, I might faint from being too embarrassed.@
`"I-I'm fine--!@ It's just a minor cold, so don't worry!"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"If it is a cold, then I can't let it go by.@ For you, a trivial illness is a big deal.@ The strength of your immune system is much lower than most people's."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Akiha seems to be fed up and puts her hand on my forehead.\

` The sensation of her cool, delicate hand.@
` White, slender fingers.@
` White, beautiful, fine fingers that men's fingers don't even come close to-----\

`"!!!!!!!!"@
` This isn't good.@
` This isn't good at all, so I break loose and run out to the lobby.\

`"Shiki-sama?@ Have you finished your breakfast already?"@
`"No, that's not it, but--Um, where's my bag?"@
`"I have your bag here.@ Are you already going to school?"@
` Nodding, I snatch my bag from Hisui.@
`"I'm going.@ Don't worry about seeing me off!"\

`"Nii-san, you've been acting strange.@ What are you doing with that fever?"@
`"Geez, I told you it's nothing!@ Since it's nothing, I'm going to school!@ I'll have breakfast later, so leave me alone!"@
`"Leave you alone--hey, Nii-san!?"@
br
` The sound of my fleeing footsteps is my only response.\

bg "image\bg\bg_32a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

`"Sigh----"@
` Even if it is Akiha, she wouldn't chase me this far.\
` Since we're not kids anymore, she won't stop me from going to school.\

`"----Whew."@
`  I take a deep breath and am finally able to calm down.@
`"……… What am I running away for?"@
` Once I calm down, I can think clearly.@
` I didn't do anything wrong, so there was no need for me to run away like that.\

`"--I don't believe it.@ I look like a complete idiot."@
` But, to go back to the mansion to eat breakfast sounds more dumb.@
`"--To school, then?"@
` Letting out a sigh, I go downhill along the residential street.\
