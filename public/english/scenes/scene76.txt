` …… For some reason, I can't decline.@
` I did kill her, after all.@
` It's my fault she's weak and has to ask others for help.@
br
` ---It is my responsibility.@
` Besides, although I've only known her for a little while, she doesn't seem like a bad person.\

`"----"@
` Argh, don't look at me with those eyes!@
` …… Why is it?@ It's making me feel overcome with guilt and unable to refuse.@
`"But now that I've gotten myself into this mess, I won't be able to sleep at night if I just deny all responsibility."@
br
` ---Man, I just know I'm going to regret this.\
`"…… So, yeah.@ I think I could probably do it.@ The enemy's the serial killer, right?@
` As a resident of this town, I'd probably be struck with some kind of divine punishment if I refused to help you."@

` …… With a very happy expression on her face, she approaches me as I lie there on my rear, up against the wall.\

br
` I grudgingly extend my left hand and shake hands with the woman in white claiming to be a vampire.\
