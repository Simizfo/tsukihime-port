` I go out to the courtyard and see Kohaku-san holding a broom.@
` I suppose she is done with the rear courtyard, and is now humming in the courtyard while sweeping the leaves.\

`"Huh?@ What is the matter, Shiki-san, coming out to the courtyard at this time?"@
`"Ah…… Nothing.@ I was just bored, so I thought I'd come help you.@ Are you done already?"@
`"Yes, I just finished the rear courtyard.@ Since there was some time before I had to prepare dinner, I thought I should sweep the courtyard as well."@
` It seems Kohaku-san is rather industrious, as she has already taken care of most of the leaves.\

`"…… I guess I'm no help.@ Kohaku-san, you almost cleaned up all the leaves in the whole courtyard already."@
`"Yes, taking care of the garden has always been my job.@ Taking care of the garden in the rear courtyard, the woods, and the maples to the south are also my responsibility."@
`"Wow, your job is not just to take care of the flower bed, but also the woods?"@
` …… Hold on a minute here.@
` Does that mean…?@
`"Um, Kohaku-san.@ There is this huge tree in the middle of the woods.@ Do you take care of that too?"\

`"No, how could I, Shiki-san?@ That tree has been at the mansion for a long time.@ I can't take care of something that big."@
` As if she was having a lot of fun, Kohaku-san smiles happily.\

`"But that tree is very important.@ From the second floor of the mansion in the hallway, you can see that tree very well.@ As a child, I would use it as a landmark to find many things."@
`"I see---I too have memories of that tree, although it was just once."@
` …… But it seems like there isn't any meaning to it anymore.@
` The girl from that time---Hisui didn't think much about the promise we made.@ It was eight years ago, so I guess it can't be helped if she thinks differently now.\


`"Ah, it's almost time.@ Well then, Shiki-san, when it's time for dinner, please come to the dining room."@

` With that, Kohaku-san disappears, her footsteps echoing in the air.@
` I'm sure all the ingredients are set, and all that remains is preparing the food.@
`"…… I guess I should head back to my room."@
` After staring a little more at the big tree in the middle of the woods, I leave the courtyard.\
