` …… It's bugging me how Akiha said that.@
` She said not to enter the detached building under any circumstances.@
` The way she said it gets me more curious.@ Besides-----if a Japanese-style room is only located there, I do feel like I want to take a look at it.@
br
`"…… I guess it's alright if I don't get caught."@
` I silently apologize to Akiha and decide to walk to the exit quietly.\

` ------The sun has set and it is pitch black outside.@
` I walk through the woods which seem more like a forest.@
` …… I didn't remember quite where it was, but as I enter the forest, my feet automatically head toward the detached building.@
` Even if I forgot where it was, I guess my body remembers how to get there.@
` At any rate, I am able to get to the detached building without getting lost.\

` It must have been many years since this building was put out of use, as many parts are deteriorated.@

` As I put my hand on the door, I notice that it is unlocked.@

` It is dark inside, as expected.@
` I smell the tatami mats and the shoji, and somehow feel comfortable even though I can't see anything.\

`"-----Ah."@
` As I enter the Japanese-style room, a chill runs through my spine.\

`"----------I know this place."@
` I guess I came here as a kid since this japanese-style room was interesting.@
`"------------"@
` But it's weird.@
` I feel the same sense of incompatibility I had when I was first shown my room after I came back to this mansion.@
`"…… Maybe because the Arimas' house was Japanese-style."@
` I feel like I've lived here all my life.@
br
` Or maybe-----\

`"Ouch------"@
` I feel a pain in my neck.@
` It might be my anemia, but my body feels like lead.@
`"…… This is bad…… I have to go back to my room."@
` I shake my head lightly, and I decide to go back to my room before I really faint.@

`"Oh hello, Shiki-san.@ What are you doing at a place like this?"@
` Kohaku-san suddenly enters the room.\

`"----------!!!"@
` I look around to see what I can do.@

`"You got curious?@ I understand.@ I'll let you go this time, but please don't come here again.@ This building is old and a bit dangerous."\

` …… This building is old and a bit dangerous, huh.@
` It's a weird reason but, it still makes sense.@
`"…… I'm sorry.@ But what was this building used for?@ You say it's not used now but did someone use it before?"@

`"Yes, this used to be the servants' residence.@ Before you went to the Arimas, this mansion had many servants.@
` It was impossible to let all the servants live in the mansion, so Makihisa-sama constructed this detached building."@
`"I see, this place was the servants' residence."\

` It does make sense now that she mentions it.@
` If you have a mansion this big, such a thing would be certainly needed.@
` But, why?@
` Why is Akiha trying to get me away from this place------?\

`"Shiki-san, we should go back to the mansion or Akiha-sama might find out."@
`"Oh-----I'm sorry."@
` I shake off the faint doubt remaining and decide to go back to the mansion with Kohaku-san.\
