` The source of the noise soon becomes apparent as I walk towards the courtyard.@
` A female student is crouching in the middle of the tree-lined path, working with a hammer and nails.\

`"……"@
` What is she doing?@ There are only a few minutes left until homeroom.@
`"---Maybe she doesn't have a watch."@
` At the moment, that's the best I can come up with.@
` …… Still, to notice and then just ignore her would be somewhat cruel.@
` I approach her unhurriedly, trying not to surprise her, and speak.\

`"Hey, homeroom is starting soon."@
`"Huh?"@
` The squatting girl raises her face.@ The ribbon on her uniform displays the color of a third-year.@
`"……"@
` The older student looks at me while holding her hammer.@
`"Uh… um…"@
` Her gaze through those glasses is so direct I feel like I'm being pulled in.@
` Her serious eyes make me want to apologize for bothering her.@
` The splint she was facing is rotten beyond use.\
` …… Come to think of it, our school's rear courtyard is in a terrible state of disrepair.@
` The splints are neglected, and the flower beds untended.@
` Apparently, the teachers intend for the students to conduct a big cleanup at the end of the year, so the maintenance men have done nothing since summer.\

` ---I take in the situation with a single glance.@
` The girl with the hammer is repairing the broken-down splints, paying no mind to the fact that her tidy uniform is being dirtied.@ She has sweat on her brow, and it looks like she had been swinging her hammer in a most serious manner.@
` …… But as far as I know, there is nobody in charge of repairing public property at this school.\

`"Um… What is it?"@
` The older student asks, adjusting her crooked glasses.@
`"Uh, it's nothing.@ I was just wondering what you were doing."@
`"Ah… as you can see, I'm in the middle of fixing the splints."@
` Yeah.@ I can see that.@
`"That's not what I meant.@ I was wondering why you are doing something like this.@ Won't the maintenance people take care of it anyway?"@
`"Ahaha…"@
` The older student laughs to hide her embarrassment.\

`"I'm the kind of person who can't stand seeing a mess like this.@ I just can't leave them alone."@
` It seems as though she is repairing the splints because she just couldn't let them stay that way.@
`"……"@
` What an odd senpai.@
`"That's why you're fixing it on your own?@ If you don't like the mess, why not just avoid coming here?"@
`"Well, my classroom is over there."@
` Senpai points at the second floor classroom facing the courtyard.\

`"My seat is next to the window, so it's easy for me to see the courtyard… Well, usually I just bear it, but when I took my seat today, I was surprised to see all the splints in this area were broken."@
` Senpai's face clouded, as if to say, "Isn't that terrible?"@
` …… Apparently she's upset, although she doesn't look seriously angry.\

`"You know what they say, 'strike while the iron's hot' and all.@ I borrowed the tools from the office, and decided to fix them myself."@
br
` And so, the explanation ends.@
br
` Making a bow, Senpai returns to hammering the nails.\
`"…… Alright, I understand all that, but how about we leave it here for now?@ Homeroom is in less than five minutes, and if it's this bad, won't the school get around to fixing it pretty soon?"@
`"No way!"@
` Gripping her hammer, the senpai with glasses shakes her head furiously.\

`"I won't be able to concentrate with the garden like this, even if I go to class.@ It'll just sound like nonsense to me, and then the teacher will say, 'Hey, you! What are you staring at?' I'll get yelled at for sure!"@
` Senpai continues to grip the hammer while she emphasizes her point.@
`"…… Well, I suppose the teacher would be upset if you kept looking outside."@
`"He would, wouldn't he?@ That's why I have to do it now."@
` With that, Senpai begins her repairs once again, clumsily hammering away.@ She's obviously not used to using a hammer.\

bg "image\bg\bg_04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` *Clank* *Clank* rings the hammer as it hits the wood.@
` …… By the looks of it, there isn't just one or two broken splints.@
` I can't begin to guess how long it will take her to repair all of them on her own.@

` Once I began to help, I quickly realize mending them isn't that difficult after all.@
` Although the older student is not used to making repairs, she is quite skillful anyway.@ She has already gotten the hang of it, and work is proceeding at a brisk pace.@
` Senpai's movements are quick and sharp, and I enjoy watching her.@ She really is quite clever.@
` …… Before I know it, there is only one splint left to repair.\
br
` Thirty minutes have passed.@
` I can't stay here any longer, and only one more would be no problem for Senpai.\

`"Well, I'll be going."@
` I stand up and dust off my pants.@
` The student with the glasses also stands up and begins to stare at me.@

` Come to think of it, just who is she?@
` I hadn't given it any thought because of what I was doing, but when I stop to consider her I realize she is quite beautiful.@
` Someone this good looking would be known by every male student.@ They'd be talking about a "third-year beauty".\

`"Um… I have to go.@ Don't work too hard, Senpai."@

` When I reach my class, it's already the break after first period.\

` I slip into the room while everyone's busy talking.@
