` ---Before that footstep even fades, I spring into action.@
br
`"Here---------!"@
br
` Akiha's voice is a mixture of malice and pleasure.@
` Enjoying the tension of battle, she smiles as she looks in my direction.@
`"---------"@
` That carelessness is my only chance and her only reason for loss.\

`"Not good enough, Nii-san.@ No matter how fast you are, you just get clearer as you get closer to me-----!"@
` Her voice is full of delight.@

` Her eyes catch a hold of me.@
` Then, the rest is simple.@
` I won't be able to reach her, as she'll evaporate my arms and legs, and collapse to the floor.@
br
` -----Well,
` that is, only if she can fix her eyes on me until I am completely burned away.\

` My view reverses.@
`"----------Eh?"@
` Her voice is full of surprise.@
` In that same instant, the red hair that was to burn my arms and legs vanishes.@
` It's fortunate that the hallway is just a straight line.@
` Akiha, who thought I would only attack directly, can't see me as I climb up the wall and jump to the ceiling.\

` Proceeding up the wall like a spider, my foot touches the ceiling only once.@
` It's not like I can actually be a spider.@
` Turning my body, I'm just using the ceiling for a foothold.@
br
` The distance is good enough.@
` Before my body falls, I use my legs to thrust off the ceiling.\

`"Uh, eh------?"@
` Akiha's gaze shifts upwards and the burning sensation returns to my arms and legs.@
` The feeling stops in an arm and a leg.@
` They probably don't exist anymore.@
` But, I don't need them any longer.@
` My body has the speed it needs.@
` Like this----

br
`"Kyaa--------!?"@
br
` I collide into Akiha.\

`"Why, you--------!"@
` Akiha lifts her head.@
` Being this close to her, she can easily find me and disintegrate my body.@

br
` So,
` before that happens, I cut it apart.@
br
` That delicate neck.@ I cut it horizontally through her pulsing veins.@
` Making no differentiation between her skin, her muscles, her arteries, her bones,!w1500 without mercy or compassion,!w1500 like plucking a lily,!w1500 without even any resplendent pain.\

br
` Thud.\

` On the hard floor, something that's shaped like a bowling ball drops.@
` It's all over.@ Her eyes are cluelessly looking at the wall of the hallway, and probably will continue to do so for all of eternity.\
br
`"Is that the last thing you saw?"@
br
` Her eyes being lower than that of a dog or a cat's, she fixes her gaze towards the dirty wall.@
` Everywhere is darkness.@ Dying while watching this scenery, it's like a bad joke.@
br
`"…… Didn't the old man teach you that taking pleasure in killing is shallow, Akiha?"@
br
` …… Well, that would've been useless.@ Tohno Makihisa was shallow, so her messing up like that was inevitable.\

`"…… What a shame.@ Even though you were this talented, the fire that formed you was too weak."@
br
` That's why I could kill her so easily.@
` Doing useless things like enjoying killing.@
` You did that, so you died.@
` In this place, all alone.@
` Forever alone, staring at that wall that no one ever watches, not even letting out the final agonies of death.@
br
`"…………………… Ha."@
br
` Hmph.@
` Even though she is my sister, she looks so pathetic.\


`"-----------Ahh."@
` My stopped breathing resumes.@
` My burnt body feels power flowing into it once more.@
` …… Because Kohaku-san died, my body was losing its power.@
` But since Akiha died, it seems like I am returning to normal.@
` Well, in the first place,
` this body, this head, this heart, even if I embrace them and live, there is nothing-------\

` *pant*---*pant*----*pant*----
` My breathing returns.\
` My numb arm and leg still seem to be holding their shape.@
` On the floor, Akiha's blood finally starts to spill outward.@
`"Aah----------ah."@
` Crawling to the wall, I manage to stand up on one leg.@
` I open the window and fresh air streams in.@
` The cold wind blows through the baking hallway.\

`"-------Aha.@ Hahaha, ha."@
` This wind feels extremely good.@
` It cools my burning body and my headache ceases.@
`"----Haha…… ha…… ah----"@
`  So why?@
` Only my thoughts, as if my head is becoming empty.@ Everything feels the same and my vision does not return to normal from the red world I'm in.\

` ------Above my head is the crimson moon.@
br
` I remember that one dream.@
` That moon looking down at that killer.@
` Even at that time, it was a beautiful moon, so why?@
` Why can't it evenly illuminate me tonight?@
br
` -----Like a snake.@
br
` Like an inflamed red eye, it stares at me.@
` Staring.@ The red eye looks down on me intently.\

` Red.@ Red, red, red eye.@
`"…… Ha…… haha…… I understand it now----"@
` That made it all clear.@
` What Akiha was looking at in her last moments wasn't the wall.@
` She was looking at Nanaya Shiki as he approached to mechanically slice her neck.@
`"…… I see.@ Then----it won't go away, will it."@
` Then, the moon will always be red.@
` In her eyes, the killer is still burning.@
` That can't be erased.\

` That's why even though everything is over, I have nowhere to go.@
` I lost Kohaku-san, I even killed Akiha.@
` There really is nowhere I can go.@
` All purpose, even my self, has disappeared.@
` Despite that, my only leg limps down the hallway.@
br
` ----The sky overhead still has that giant eye.@
br
` With Akiha still watching him, Nanaya Shiki walks off to somewhere.\
