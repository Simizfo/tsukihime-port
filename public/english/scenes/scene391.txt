` A dream where I killed someone.@
` A dream where I ejaculated over and over as I killed.\

`"That… can't be."@
` That can't be.@
` That was a dream.@ Unmistakably a dream.@
` But are dreams really that vivid?@
` I remember it so vividly.@
` The street in the dead of night,
` the feeling of snapping someone's neck,
` the stickiness of blood gurgling down my throat,
` the face of the woman so cruelly killed-----\

` But the problem is…
` I am dreaming that I am having fun killing people.\
