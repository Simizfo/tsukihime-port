`"Here ya go, lunch for three people… huh?@ What, am I interrupting something?"@

`"No, nothing of the sort, Senpai.@

` You are a friend of Nii-san?@ I am Tohno Shiki's younger sister, Akiha.@ It is a pleasure to meet you."@
` Akiha bows softly.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Not at all, the pleasure's mine.@ I'm Inui Arihiko, I've known Tohno since junior high, but today was the first time I've found out about you, Akiha-chan."@
` …… Maybe he's still holding a grudge against me for not telling him about her, as he says things he doesn't have to.\

`"Alright, Arihiko, let's eat.@ Lunch break is short, so there's no time for chit-chat with Akiha."@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` I ignore Akiha glaring at me, and I accept the lunch from Arihiko.@
`"Here, Akiha.@ Here's curry bread and milk, and you can eat them here.@ There isn't much time, so you can't take too long over them."\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I know that.@ I'm not a child, so you don't have to explain every little thing to me."@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's right, Tohno.@ Aren't you a bit mean to Akiha-chan?"@
` Arihiko boos at me.@
`"…………"@
` Ignoring them, I open my own bread, and stick the straw into my milk.\

` Right.@ Lunch is over, so it's time to go back to class.\

`"…… Ah, Nii-san."@
` Akiha speaks up timidly.@
` Looking over, I see that she hasn't even opened her curry bread yet.@
`"What is it, Akiha?@ You're not hungry?"@
`"It's… well, it's not that, it's just…"@
` She glances upward, like she's embarrassed or something.@

`"…… Could you… teach me how to eat these…?"@
br
`"……"@
` She glances hesitantly towards me.@
` And… what am I supposed to say?\

`"Waddya mean, how to eat them?@ You just break open the wrapper and eat it.@ It's not hard, is it Tohno?"@
`"Arihiko, sorry, but could you go get a napkin from the cafeteria?"@
`"…… Eh, me?"@
` I nod silently.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Fine, but you'll owe me one."@

` Arihiko runs off towards the school building again.\

`"Alright, give it to me.@ You open the bag here, like this.@ And you just bite into it… it's okay, but don't expect too much for the taste.@ Kohaku-san's cooking and this are like heaven and earth."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ahh… really, Nii-san?"@
`"I'm not kidding.@ Or what are you going to say?@ Don't tell me that even though you've transferred to our school, you can't eat our food.@
` I don't want to think less of you."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t17a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, it's not that, it's just… this bread, it's so big, I don't think I could get it into my mouth…"@
`"…… No one said you have to eat it all in one bite.@ It's bread, so you bite off a bit at a time.@ You'll get crumbs round your mouth, but Arihiko's bringing you a napkin to wipe it, okay?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Yes.@ Thank you, Nii-san."@

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

` Saying so, Akiha starts to bite into the curry bread.@
` …… I don't think there ever was a girl getting this nervous to start eating curry bread.\

` It's a few minutes after Akiha finished her lunch.@
` Arihiko's appearance doesn't seem to bother her, as they are engaged in pleasant conversation.\

`"So Inui-san, you have been a friend of Nii-san's since junior high school?"@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah, I've known him for about five years now.@ He's been a bothersome guy since the moment we met.@ I helped him out with all kinds of stuff, and before I knew it, he kind of grew on me."@
`"…… Arihiko, that's the wrong word.@ You should call it extortion."@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ahh, whatever you wanna call it, we're stuck with each other!"@
` Arihiko laughs.\

`"Yeah.@ Kind of like how stuff sticks to the bottom of your shoe.@ I guess we both give each other a lot of trouble."@
` I return Arihiko's laugh cynically.@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\aki_t13a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"………………"@
` …… Somehow, Akiha seems to be having trouble stomaching Arihiko and myself.\

`"Oh, by the way Akiha-chan, can I ask you something?"@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Certainly, if it is something I can answer."@
`"Well, I've been wondering for a while… Tohno has chronic anemia, right?@ Was he always like this?"@
` …… The amazing thing about Arihiko is how he is so straightforward when asking awkward questions like this.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, Nii-san has been anemic since birth.@ But all the people of the Tohno family have similar problems; his is not a special case."@
`"Eh…?@ Really, Akiha?"@
`"Yes.@ Father suffered from manic depression.@ Divergent Identity Disorder, to give it its full title."\

`"Wha?@ Divergent Identity…?"@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"More commonly called split personalities.@ Though, Father's wasn't severe enough to cause muddiness of memory."@

` ----I didn't know.@
br
` But looking back on it, Tohno Makihisa's character did seem to switch often from tenderness to brutality.\

`"Hmm… so, it was a medical condition, that old man…"@
` Looking at it like that, everything becomes clear.@
` Before the accident, I always felt father was a tender man, who kept his distance.@
` But after the accident, Makihisa clearly hated me.@
` Looking back, it may have been because of his condition.\
