` Apparently, Akiha tried to visit me a few times when I first was entrusted to the Arimas.@
` Unfortunately, we were never able to meet because I had to go to the hospital every day.@ We completely lost contact after Akiha went to a boarding school.@
` Unlike Akiha, I am isolated from the main family.@
` That's why I can live freely like this.@ My high school is just an average high school and our chance of contact was pretty much zero.\

` My old man died and I received word telling me to come back.@
` To be blunt, I had no intention whatsoever of returning to the Tohno house.@
` But Akiha is at that house.\

` Akiha was an obedient child, always looking frightened, as if she were constantly enduring something.@ She would always follow close behind, her footsteps pattering behind me.@
` She was frail, and her long black hair and fancy western clothes made her resemble a French doll.\

` I am worried about her living all alone in that big mansion, with the old man gone.@ But more than anything----I feel guilty, after pushing all the Tohno family responsibilities on her and selfishly living a free life by myself.\

` Perhaps my acceptance to return to the mansion is like my apology to Akiha.@

` Surrounded by iron railings, you could say the entire lot is abnormally expansive, being so large that a whole elementary school could fit inside.\

` The garden, surrounded by trees, is more like a forest.@ The mansion is at the heart of that forest, and there are a few other buildings separated from it.@
` I didn't think anything of it when I was a child, but now that I have lived in an ordinary household for eight years, the excessive size feels almost criminal.\

` The gates aren't locked.@
` I push them open, and head towards the mansion doors.\

` Perhaps attributing my hesitance to distrust, the girl tilts her head a little.\

`"Eh--Yeah, but you don't have to call me '-sama'."@
`"You are, right?@ Oh, please don't scare me like that!@ I was beginning to think I had made another mistake back there."@

` But in spite of that, there's a smile on her face, and it doesn't break the warm feeling about her.\

` This must mean that she's…\

`"Indeed.@ But you, on the other hand, have not changed much at all."@
` Akiha answers coldly, her eyes closed.\
`"……"@
` …… Well, I came prepared for something like this.@
` It is as I had thought.@ It seems Akiha does not think well of me.\

`"If you are feeling well, let us finish our conversation.@ You have yet to hear the details about why you were called back here, Nii-san?"@
`"I've heard nothing more than a sudden 'Come back to the mansion', though I found out the old man passed away in the papers."\

` …… If the head of a major company dies, it definitely makes it in the financial papers.@
` Word of Tohno Makihisa's death reached his son, Tohno Shiki, via the newspaper after the funeral.@
` Even though his relatives hadn't told him, this disinherited son could pick up news of his father's death merely by buying a one hundred yen newspaper.@
` It might be cynical of me to say so, but the world has certainly become a convenient place.\

`"…… I am sorry.@ It was my fault that you did not get the news about Father."@
` Akiha quietly lowers her head.@
`"It's alright.@ Either way, it's not like he would come back from the dead if I went.@ It's not something you should be worried about."@
`"…… I am sorry.@ It is somewhat comforting to hear you say that."\
` Akiha's face is serious, but this is not a topic I care much about.@
` A funeral is a ceremony for those who cannot let go of their feelings for the deceased to achieve such detachment.@ For someone like me, who cut off such feelings a long time ago, there is no need.\
