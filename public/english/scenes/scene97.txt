`"Then, it's decided.@ It's alright, Shiki.@ With your skills, you'll have no problem killing him."@
` Arcueid states this outrageous thing with a straight face.@
` …… Well, I'm not as optimistic as she is, but I've got no choice.\

`"The question is how I'll act to do that.@ I froze as soon as I looked into his eyes at the hotel, so I think all I can do is to approach him from behind so he won't notice me and then get him somehow."@
`"Oh, that.@ That was just because your will is weak, Shiki.@ Nrvnqsr's Mystic Eyes are nothing special, so if you just discard your doubts, you should be able to deflect his gaze even if you look right into his eyes."@
`"…………"@
` Arcueid casually mentions it, but I'm still nervous.\

`"…… No, I'd better not plan on doing something I've never done.@ I'm going to approach him from behind and cut the 'lines' on his limbs.@ That ought to take away his freedom of movement, and--"@
`"--If you do that, Shiki, you will die."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t05b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Eh--?"@
`"You say the question is how you'll act.@ That's not right.@ The real question is how you'll kill."@
`"--That's true, but…"\

`"Shiki, you are about to fight a monster called a vampire, so throw away your human morals, even if it's just for tonight.@ They'll only weigh you down in the crucial moments."@
`"--I understand that much.@ He's a monster, so that's why I wanted to help you stop him."\

`"No, you don't understand.@ Cut off his limbs?@ Don't do something so suicidal.@ If you've got the time to cut off his limbs, first cut off his life.@
` Nobody else can but you.@ Listen to me and don't give Nrvnqsr the chance to retaliate.@ The difference in your offensive abilities is just too great; if you miss your first strike, you've got no chance of winning whatsoever."\

` Arcueid's eyes are unforgiving of any denial.@
` ---It's true.@
` It's exactly as she says.@ If I take my time cutting his limbs off first, I might find my head being eaten by the mouth of a crocodile as I do so--\

`"Shiki.@ Nrvnqsr will come at midnight tonight.@ That's when we'll---no, when you and I will kill him until he can be killed no further.@
` Not how to act.@
` But how to kill, think only about that."@
br
` Arcueid's savage eyes are staring straight at me.@
` She is---really angry.@
` Angry that I still hold such naive notions.\

`"---I understand.@ I won't hesitate.@
` I'll take out his 'point of death' in a single strike.@ That's what I should do, right, Arcueid?"\
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"…………"@
` Arcueid doesn't answer.@
` I suppose her silence indicates agreement.@

`"---But where should we wait?@ Bystanders are going to get killed like back at the hotel if we wait here in these apartments.@ Shouldn't we change our location?"@
`"---Yes.@ I think the park will be suitable.@ No one's there late at night--and if anyone happens to pass by, it's their own bad luck."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t22.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` Saying that, Arcueid turns her back to me.\

`"What's wrong?@ If you've got something to say, then say it.@ I've decided to help you, so I'm willing to take risks."@
`"…… It's useless.@ You haven't used the word 'kill' even once.@ At this rate, you'll just hesitate at the last moment and be killed."@
`"---That's not true.@ He's a monster who's eaten over a hundred people.@ There's no way I'd hesitate to kill him."@
`"--------"@
` Arcueid gives a small sigh.\

`"---If I controlled you, I could make sure you killed Nrvnqsr.@
` I've felt that I wanted to do so for the first time, but I also felt that I didn't want to for the first time.@ It's kind of like a big contradiction."@
` …… Arcueid turns to face me, mumbling something I didn't really understand.\
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I trust you, Shiki.@ Let's get Nrvnqsr together."@
` A smile comes over Arcueid's face.@
br
` But her smile looks really uneasy.@

` The plan itself is unbelievably simple.@
` Just a little before midnight, Arcueid leaves the room and heads towards the park first.@
br
` Nrvnqsr's familiar---that blue crow, according to Arcueid---should follow her, so I leave the room and go to the park just a bit after she does.\

` Then, I'll hide in a bush where I can see Arcueid, and wait for Nrvnqsr to arrive.@ While Arcueid keeps his attention, I approach him from behind and cut his 'line of death'----\

` ---Arcueid stands absent-mindedly in the middle of the park.@
br
` I hide in a bush about twenty meters away.\

`"…………"@
` The park is empty.@
` It's ten minutes before midnight.@
` Arcueid has her head tilted up, watching the blue moon above her.\

`"…………"@
` I grip the knife tightly.@
` Arcueid said that Nrvnqsr will definitely come.@
` So all I have to do is get behind him, approach him without making too much noise, and then cut his 'line' in one breath.\

`"Haa------ahh."@
` I try taking a deep breath.@
` My body is moving just fine.@
` Except my fingers gripping the knife.@ They are tight and immobile, as if not part of my body.\

`"------"@
` Maybe I'm nervous.@
` That the vampire called Nrvnqsr will come again.@
` That I'll have to confront that monster again.\

`"------"@
` Or,
` that I have to kill him soon.\

` *pant*@
` My breathing speeds up.@
` My heart pounds, as if it's not a part of my body.@
`"Calm down--he isn't even here yet."@
` That's right.@ The target has yet to arrive.@
` I'm beginning to worry I won't even be able to move my feet by the time Nrvnqsr arrives at this rate.\

`"Arcueid… aren't you scared?"@
` I stare at the white girl vacantly looking up at the moon.@
` She doesn't look uneasy at all.@
` Her face looking up at the moon comes down.@
` At the same time--
br
`"---It seems I have kept you waiting, Princess of the True Ancestors."@
br
` A heavy voice, like rusted iron.\

`"------!"@
` That's why Arcueid looked down.@
` More than five meters away from her, and more than ten meters away from me, a man in a black coat appears like a ghost---\

`"Yes.@ I've been waiting for quite some time, Nrvnqsr Chaos.@
` Or would you prefer I call you Fabro Rowan?@ Sounds classier."@
br
` Arcueid's voice reaches me through the wind.\

` Just what one would expect of our Executioner.@ I suppose you have long since found out all there is to know about the current Twenty-Seven Ancestors of the Dead Apostles."@
