` For no reason at all, I thought.@
` I thought that if I didn't see Senpai now, I'll never see her again normally.\

`"If you made some sort of promise, I will go and tell them for you, so please go back to your room and--"@
`"Shut up!@ I'm telling you to get out of my way……!"@
`"Ah----"@
` I violently push her away and dash towards the door.\
