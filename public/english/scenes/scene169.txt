` For the time being, the movie theater is always a safe bet.@ As long as the movie you choose is good, it can't be boring.@

` Arcueid walks right next to me.@

`"------"@
` On the way----actually even now, everyone around us keeps casting glances our way.@
` …… It doesn't need to be said, but it's probably because Arcueid really stands out.\

` I'm aware of it a little, but everyone else's reactions make me even more conscious of it, and it's a bit troubling.@
br
` Arcueid acts just like she normally does, but since I can't help but be overwhelmed by her femininity, I can't seem to make any meaningful conversation.\

`"Hey, do you hear me Shiki?@ I'm asking you where we're going."@
`"Ah----um, well most couples here usually go to the movie theater."@
` I point to the movie theater in front of us.\

`"Movie theater…… hmm, so watching a movie then."@
` …… The princess does not seem to be pleased.@
` But, after coming this far, I don't have a choice.@
` It's not like I have any clue what would please a vampire girl in the first place.@
` Because I've gone this far, I just have to prepare myself for her to say "Boring."\

`"Just go in.@ If you're dissatisfied, we can always split up here."@
`"I'm not really… dissatisfied."@
` Giving a sigh, Arcueid follows me.@

` She slumps her shoulders as if to say "you good-for nothing guy!".\

`"I'm going to go buy tickets, but what do you want to see?@ Let's see, there's a romance, and a romance, and a romance…… this theater kind of stinks."@
` To be honest, I want to go back too.@

`"Any one of them is fine.@ They really all look the same."@
`"Yeah.@ Then let's just buy one."@

` I get in the shortest line and buy two tickets.\

`"Here you go.@ Just show this ticket when we go in.@ They'll take half of the ticket, but that's how it's supposed to be so don't get angry."@

` Giving a small "hmph", she turns her face away and walks towards the theater.\

` …… It was a mistake.@

` ----We exit the theater.@

` We watched a romance… it wasn't exactly boring, but not terribly interesting either.@
` It was a typical French movie.@ It focused less on breathtaking scenes and concentrated more on creating a calm atmosphere.@
` As we leave the theater, Arcueid walks with me wordlessly.\

`"…………"@
` …… An uncomfortable silence.@
` Maybe she would've been happier if it was an action flick or a horror movie.@

`"Hey, Arcueid."@

` Wh, wh, wha, what……!?\

`"Uh, fun, Arcueid?"@
`"Man, hearing about it and seeing it were two entirely different things.@ Even though I knew some background information about what a movie theater was, my imagination fell short of reality."@
` …… Arcueid gives a happy, heartfelt smile.\

`"The darkness was really nice, and even though the sounds were loud, they weren't noisy.@ And having you next to me was also fun.@
` But more than that, the subject matter was really good!@ I was surprised they would go so far to make up a story.@ It's so detailed, my imagination was nothing like that.@ I was really moved."@
`"…… Ah, is… is that so?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t11.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Huh?@ You look like you don't agree.@ Was it boring?"@
`"No, not really boring, just ordinary.@ There's way more interesting things than that."\

`"No way.@ That was really good, you know!?"@
`"Well, I guess movie experts like that kind of movie, but there's a ton of better ones.@
` They are not out right now, but there are epics out there many times better than that.@
` To be blunt, what we just saw was pretty low quality."@

`"…… I'm surprised."@

`"…… It's so easy to read your expressions Arcueid."\

` Not just surprised, but amazed.@
` That Arcueid, she looked so not into it, so I thought she was going to complain… but now she's like an excited kid.@
br
`"…… Too bad.@ If it was earlier, we could've seen a better movie.@ If I knew you would have liked it, I would have taken you."@
br
` It's not so she thanks me, but I genuinely do want to make her happy.\

`"Oh, I see.@ I guess we don't have much luck."@
` Arcueid slumps her shoulders in disappointment.@
`"Yeah, we just keep missing the opportunities."@
` I slump my shoulders in disappointment too.@
` …… Yeah, really.@
` It really would have been nice to see her happy, smiling face a little longer.\
