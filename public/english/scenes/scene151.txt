` Class ends.@

` Because it's lunchtime, there may be one or two students going there.@
` Before that, I have to send her away from school……!\

` I pant with exertion.@
` I exit the hallway and out into the courtyard.@
` Fortunately, no one else has gone outside.@
` All that's left is to grab Arcueid, but…

` …… Thank goodness.@ Arcueid's hostility seems to fade.@

`"Ah…… Senpai."@

` For Senpai to just disappear like that without saying anything must mean something.\
