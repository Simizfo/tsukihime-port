` SHIKI, he killed my adopted son who happened to be there.@
` (The adopted son is the heir of the house Nanaya. I guess it is a blessing in all the unfortunate events that he isn't in the same family as the Synchronizers, like Kohaku and Hisui.)
` SHIKI's inversion impulse is terrible.@ So it was determined that he must be eliminated.@ I have my duty as the head of the Tohno household, but killing my own son is so difficult.\

` The Tohno blood is stronger in SHIKI than in AKIHA.@
` Talking about potential, I feel an older origin in Akiha's blood, but SHIKI's Tohno blood runs much stronger.@
` I assume that is why SHIKI inverted before he became an adult.@
` SHIKI's powers are "immortality" and "fusion".@
` SHIKI could not manage the awakened powers and as a result, killed the adopted Nanaya child, taking his life.@
` I have to say it was a superb job for using his powers for the first time.\

` As long as he lives, I've decided to use him.@

` Complementarity.@
` The Nanayas are a family that produces killers.@
` If that adopted son happens to stay alive, the link between him and SHIKI may corrupt SHIKI's mind.@
` Even if SHIKI regains his sanity, I cannot deny the possibility of the Nanaya child's influence turning him into a killer.@
br
` To prevent this from occurring, we must have him somewhere where we can keep an eye on him.@ But we cannot allow him near the Tohno mansion either.@

` But I have to be careful.@
` Her ability to "plunder" is a double-edged sword.@ She might plunder someone's entire concept while plundering their heat.@

`"A killer, what do you mean?"@
`"………………"@
br
` I can't keep it a secret any longer.@
` Everything I did up until now----the dream I had last night, the bloodstains I can not explain, and that dream where Akiha killed me.\

`"…… I can't trust myself.@ I thought those were just dreams.@
` But my old man wrote that the Nanaya were a family that produced killers.@ If I become like SHIKI, I don't know what I will do to you, Akiha."@
` I lay it all out to her from the bottom of my heart.@
` But, after blinking in surprise, she tries not to laugh.\

`"Wha, what's so funny?@ This isn't a joke.@ …… You may not believe me, but I really have dreams of sucking people's blood……!"@
` Akiha is still giggling.@
` …… What is this?@
` She makes me look stupid, worrying about all of this.\

`"Yeah, it is funny.@ See, you can't be a vampire.@ Because you are from the Nanaya family, your blood is only human.@
` Besides, the Nanayas are not killers.@
` …… Certainly from Father's point of view, they are, but the only ones that the Nanaya feel a homicidal impulse towards are nonhumans.@
` So what you saw had to be just dreams.@ And even those dreams are probably SHIKI transmitting to you, so it isn't that you want to see them."\

` …… SHIKI transmitted them?@
` Come to think of it, my old man did write something about that.@
` SHIKI stole some of my life, so there is like a link between us.\

`"…… I see.@ Then who is killing on the streets right now?@ Even if what I saw was just a dream, there are victims showing up on the streets in reality---"@

` No, putting that off to the side.@ If there's a killer on the streets, then---\

`"Father's journal……?"@
` Akiha tilts her head, curious.@
`"My old man wrote that SHIKI and I were connected.@ Then maybe what I saw were really his dreams."@
` …… No, it's more likely what he's actually doing.\

`"…… That may be a possibility.@ Father's death was suspicious, and it did seem like someone was being raised in the underground cell."@
`"…… Wait a minute, Akiha.@ Do we have such a thing like an underground cell here?"@
`"Oh, of course.@ There are a lot of members of the Tohno family who lose their sanity, so it is only natural to lock them away before they can hurt the outside world, right?@
` Well, that isn't all it is used for.@ When I got in trouble, Father would lock me up down there."@
` For some reason, Akiha sounds like she is having fun.@
` …… A chill runs down my spine.\

`"…… I get it.@ We'll stop talking about it.@ We have to do something about SHIKI, though.@
` If SHIKI really is wandering the streets killing people, then we have to stop him."@
`"Is that so?@ We really do not have to concern ourselves about him, do we?@ Is it not the job of the police to take care of killers?"\

`"Wha----Akiha, what are you saying?@ He's killing people, but he is your brother.@ He has to pay for his crime, but still---"@
`"…… Goodness, Nii-san.@ You are really too nice of a person."@
` Taking a breath, she brushes her hair back.\

`"You are my only relative.@ I do not care about SHIKI, so you do not have to worry about him."@
`"No, we can't just do that.@ Do you think the police can catch him so easily?@ And before then, there will be more victims!"@
`"I will not do anything.@ That is, not our responsibility."@
` She says this and looks me directly in the eye.\

`"Hey, let's not speak of these matters any longer.@ Talking about murder and killers is boring, isn't it?"@
`"Wha-----"@
` I try to tell her that it has to do with our family, but I can't.@
` …… Her eyes pierce into me deeply.@
` Staring at me like that, her eyes seem to take away my resolution.\
