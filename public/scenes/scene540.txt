` You have reached Akiha's Normal Ending.@ Well done.@
br
` Each heroine (with one exception) has two different kinds of endings.@
` Usually, they are called "True Ending" and "Good Ending", but Akiha-san's are called "Normal Ending" and "True Ending".@
br
` Akiha-san's route is different from everyone else's in that how much Akiha-san likes you does not determine which ending you receive.\

` It also differs from all other routes in that it has an extra Normal Ending, which is what you are reading right now.@ While this ending is called Akiha's Normal Ending, it will not register as an ending in the game.@

`"Nya?@ What is this?@ You're talking nonsense!@
br
` Take it up with the game designers if you must.@
` Tohno-kun, please proceed to play through Akiha-san's route to reach her real Normal Ending.\

` Well then, thank you very much for playing up to this point.@
br
` Let's meet again somewhere in Tsukihime.\
