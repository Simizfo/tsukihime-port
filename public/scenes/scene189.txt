` Even if you die, if you could preserve your sense of self and start over again as a new human, that would be eluding death.@
` …… Well, when he isn't completely annihilated, he isn't dead, so it's actually not quite eluding death."\

`"Reincarnation---you mean if he dies he will start over as a baby?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` As soon as that baby has the intelligence to succeed 'his self', the baby becomes a new vampire that is him."\

`"---Wait a minute.@ What's that?@ Don't tell me that he does surgery on it while it's in the mother or something like that."\

`"No, it's not anything medical.@ Because the instant his body is destroyed, he reincarnates into the body he chose as his next body.\
`"I said all of 'his information' earlier, but to use simpler terms, think of it as his 'soul'.@
` It wouldn't be quite correct to say his soul propagates through the air and takes over someone's body, but it's similar to an electromagnetic wave.@ In this case, the human brain is what does the transmitting and the receiving.@
` His exceptional point is that he took this soul, which is incalculable and something that disperses as soon as it leaves the envelope of the body, and processed it as something that could be transmitted."\

`"…… Sorry, Senpai.@ I can't see how this relates to you coming to my school."@

` Because he is properly born as a human baby and has parents.@ He transforms into a vampire only when he reaches the age where he can do everything at a satisfactory level.\

`"Until then, that human shows no hint of being a vampire.@ But once he awakens, he uses the relationships he gained until that time to blend perfectly into society.@

`"…… Technically, but there is a limit, Tohno-kun.@
` The vampiric impulse has no end, and it will not go away.@ The resisted urges which build again and again will eventually overflow their vessel.@
` The longer they live, the larger the vampiric impulse in them gets.@
` And when they can no longer restrain themselves with their own power--when the impulse overwhelms their power, their lives are ended by others.@
` That is the life span for those without life spans."\

`"…… Perhaps.@ But she's reached her limit already.@
` Even though she was only actually active for a few years, the amount of time of her existence does not change.@

` She---Arcueid's life cannot be saved."\

`"She deals with them not for our sakes, but because it is her purpose."@
`"Purpose---who decided that?"\

`"Probably the other True Ancestors.@ She was born in the 12th century when there were many fallen True Ancestors.@
` The True Ancestors could not ignore their fallen kin nor the Dead Apostles increasing in number.@
` That's why they created something solely for killing.@
` Without a need for anything else, the most pure True Ancestor created for punishment.@
` That is the True Ancestor called Arcueid.@
` She's like a nuclear missile without a mind of its own, once she leaves the castle, her target is definitely destroyed."\

` …… She should stop saying that.@
` She's a person.@ Talking about her like she's just some sort of weapon makes me mad.\

`"No, she is a weapon.@ In the first place, she existed only for that purpose.@

` The wide, castle courtyard.@
` The unadorned grassy field inside the solitary castle.@
` The white girl stares blankly up at the sky.\

`"She did not have any extra knowledge, or freedom beyond what was needed for her purpose.@
` She only goes outside when her target is determined.@
` She gets taught only the information needed to definitely destroy the enemy."\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` No one is there.\
` No one to talk to.@
` Not even another face to see.\

`"After killing her target and when she returns to the castle, her taught knowledge is washed out and she is taken to sleep.@
` Without knowing anything, nothing other than killing vampires."\

br
br
br
br
` There's nothing.@
` Such as the fun of speaking with someone else.@
` The precious moments of seeing someone else and greeting them.@
` She was excluded from all of it.\

`"Her power was strong enough to defeat the fallen True Ancestors.@ …… But, it's ironic.@ She was so powerful that she was shunned by the rest of the True Ancestors.@
` Even while praising her as the princess, no one approached her.@
` Even while giving her a castle, her world was only the dark basement.@
` So there was nothing to give her any feelings."\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` That's,
` almost enough to make me pity her for living.@
` A parody of life.\

`"She apparently had no words or even time of her own.@ --The True Ancestors treated her only as a weapon.@
` A weapon has no need for extra functions, such as baking bread or doing laundry.@
` If you're going to put on extra functions, you would put on something more fit for a weapon, right?"\

br
br
br
br
br
` --I was always taught never to do extra things.\
br
br
br
` Yes, she has said that before.@
` The reason for deciding everything for herself, for having those empty eyes.@
br
` That's why she never needed anyone else.@
` No, maybe she never knew about it.\

`"All they wanted of her was to be a superior killing machine.@
` That's why she doesn't know anything.@ I don't mean something big like the meaning of life, but not even the small joy of just living normally."\

br
br
br
br
br
` She was always so cheerful.@
` Even trivial things made her so happy.@
br
` So I thought she was always like that.\
br
br
br
br
br
` …… But I was horribly wrong.@
` She really was---just enjoying those simple things.@
` She must have enjoyed those things so much.\

br
br
br
br
br
` ---Because it's so fun.@
` I never thought about how life could be fun just by living.\
br
br
br
br
br
` Like it was an uneasiness she couldn't understand,
` The classroom filled with the red setting sun where she asked me those questions with a reserved voice.\

`"Even though Arcueid has existed for so long, she knows less about living than we do.@
` If you convert it to the time she was allowed to move freely, it is amazingly short.@
` Her lifetime was spent almost entirely in sleep.@
` Most likely a deep, dark sleep."\

`"After dealing with all the fallen True Ancestors, she did not leave the castle.@ Having fulfilled her purpose, the True Ancestors sought to educate her properly.@
` However, she could not be free.@ Because of a slight mistake, she ended up killing all the True Ancestors remaining in the castle."\

br
br
br
br
br
` Maybe the one that was taught how to kill vampires really did finish her job until the very end.@
` In the end, she was left alone.\

`"After killing all the True Ancestors, she sealed herself up in the castle.@ In the empty castle of the True Ancestors, bound with a thousand chains.@
` Whenever Roa is reborn, she awakens from her sleep and moves around for a short time."\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` In the middle of that fixed world,
` She never said a single word.\

`"That's why she is a killer down to her very core.@
` Even though the True Ancestors which bound her are now gone, she still wanders around with the sole purpose of killing vampires.@
` She probably does not have any other fun."\
