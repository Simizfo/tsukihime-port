` If you think the other way around, you just have to look for families with those traits.@ When you know that, finding him is very simple.@
` It's easy to find families that have special abilities passed down through their blood once you do a bit of research.@ In this city, there is only one family that fits Roa's requirements.@

` I---can't say anything.\

`"Looking into it, you were fatally wounded eight years ago and adopted by your relatives.@

` He is a vampire that manipulated the shapeless thing called a soul.@ For Roa, you two who shared one life were a finely crafted double existence.\
