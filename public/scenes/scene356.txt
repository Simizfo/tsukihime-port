` I go up to the fourth floor.@
` Akiha's class is first year, class one.@ I speak to a student leaving the classroom, and ask her to call Akiha.@
`"Tohno-saaan, your brother's here!"@
` …… The girl I stopped calls out to Akiha quite directly.\

`"Do you need something, Nii-san?"@
` Akiha comes out with a sullen expression.@
`"-------"@
` Well, this is troubling.@
` Kohaku-san told me to apologize, but after hearing her story, it's a little troubling.\

`"If you don't need anything, I'll go back to my classroom."@
`"---No, there's something.@ It's… well, I mean…"@

` …… It's lunchtime.@
` Since I just went and apologized to Akiha, it feels kind of awkward to have lunch with her.@
` However.@

` …… Says one guy.@ Besides, I can't leave her by herself.@
` …………… *sigh*@
` I let out a big sigh and leave the classroom with Arihiko.\
