` I realize as I look up in the sky from the hallway,
` tonight is a full moon.\

`"……………"@
` I lose myself for a moment gazing at it.@

` Delicate beauty like glass, it feels like it will crumble if I were to reach out my hand and touch it.@
` That moon.@
` When I was a child.@ I feel like.@ I saw it.@ In a stupor.\

` The figure draws closer.@
` The moonlight seems to suggest it's a male.@
` The "point" indicating death pulsates in the center of his body like a heart.@
` All around his body are numerous "lines" of death covered like wires for a machine.\

` There's no time to think or hesitate.\

` Under the white moon.@
` As if in slow motion, I ready my knife.@
` He doesn't stop.@
br
` Slowly,
` as if time stopped only for me,
br
` he easily reaches out and takes my knife, holding it upside down.\
