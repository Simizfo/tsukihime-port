` Hello!@
` The hint corner for the poor lost Tohno-kun who ended up in a Dead End without knowing his left from his right,
` It is time for "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!"@
br
` …… I see.@
` You have come to the fifth period.@
` I think there are lots of Tohno-kuns who fall into this end.@
` Well, it is your divine punishment.@
` Regret your own unluckiness for associating with such a woman.\

` ----Now then.@

` Normally there would be no chance of salvation, but some of you came here in spite of rejecting that sunny vampire.@
br
` (Sunny even though she's a vampire, I'm picking a fight)
br
` So I'll throw out a lifeboat.\

` There are about three reasons you came to this Dead End, but to avoid it,
br
` You have to reassure your sister sometimes,
` you have to indulge a stupid woman's selfishness sometimes, and to find a dirty vampire, try going to a very dirty place.@
br
` That's about it.\

`"Hey Ciel.@ I don't get this."@
br
` ---Question denied.@
` …… Or so I'd like to say, but there seemed to be many questions on this, so I will answer it.@
` DNM is…
` D is for "dizzy", N for "not healthy", M for "moon".@
` It has the same initials as "Dark Night Moon", it's a small play on words.\

` (…… Why, that little……)
` Well, this ends the lesson this time.@
` Everyone, please remember to use proper Japanese!\
