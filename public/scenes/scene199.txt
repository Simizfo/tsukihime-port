` …… There was a brother and a sister around my same age, and we became good friends, I think.\

` But there was always a wall between their father and me.@

` Even if we weren't related by blood, we tried to believe we were a family.\

` But, that ended abruptly.@
` After a large accident, I was taken to a hospital.@
