` After that---After losing consciousness by the mansion wall, it seems like I somehow made it back here.@
` My thoughts still aren't coming together.@
` I remember the whirling events of last night.\

` And how he could see "lines" just like me.@
` After he was impaled by those swords, his body burst aflame, and with a voice that sounded like his dying curse, he ran off.\

` ………… *sigh*@

` I'll talk to her about all these strange things, but for now, I have to just return to my normal life or I'll go crazy.\

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."@
`"Yeah, morning.@ Sorry for just waking up whenever I felt like it."@
`"I apologize as well.@ I should have been there when you awoke.@ Please forgive me."@
` Hisui silently bows her head.@
` …… Being apologized to like this after I left in the middle of the night and managing to get back to my room, I suddenly feel like the worst person in the world.\

`"There's no need to apologize.@ I didn't wake up at the usual time, so it's my fault.@ It's okay if you want to voice your complaints."@
`"…… Voice, my complaints……?"@
`"Yeah.@ My friend always says I'm always a lazy bum, and he always tells me an occasional whack to my back is good to set me straight."\

`"………………"@
` Hisui stands there thinking silently as she stares at me.@
` It's like that for about a minute.@
` She doesn't even blink, but just stares at me.@
` …… I knew forcing Hisui to do such an ordinary thing would be impossible.\

`"Don't worry about... just forget it.@ More importantly, I'm kinda hungry.@ Is breakfast ready?"@
`"…… Nee-san went outside.@ Your breakfast is ready in the dining room."@
`"Oh.@ In that case, I'll go have some food.@ Sorry to bother you while you were working."@

br
` ---It's okay if you want to voice your complaints.@
br
` I said that earlier.\

`"---That was… my request?"@
` Yeah, there's no mistake.@
` Hisui was thinking about it the whole time, and was waiting for me in the sitting room just to tell me.@

` I go back to my room, but I don't really have anything to do there.@
` Thinking about what I should do next, I decide to walk around the mansion I haven't explored in eight years.\

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid
bg "image\bg\bg_33a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

` I arrive at the lobby.@
` Come to think of it, I was always getting yelled at for playing in the mansion as a kid.@
` I'm no kid anymore to play in the mansion, and my old man is also gone.@
` I used to get so excited just walking the hallways when I was a kid, but now I don't feel anything at all.@
br
` For some reason, I aimlessly wander around the mansion to confirm my childhood memories.\

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid
bg "image\bg\bg_46a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

` The hallway stretches quite a long distance.@
` When I was a child, I believed this hallway would go on forever.@
br
` The mansion seemed as large as a castle and every day, I would walk a bit around the mansion and carve my name on the wall, the pillars, or the floor.@
` It was sort of a game I would play with Akiha to see who could take over the mansion.@
` Saying that wherever I put my name became my territory, it really was just the two of us walking around the mansion and carving our names here and there.\

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
bg "image\bg\bg_46a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Oh, here.@ Still here."@
` On the handrail by the stairs is carved the name SHIKI.\
` It was probably because of these games that my old man forbade us from playing inside the mansion.@
` Anyway, if I look closely, I can see both my name and Akiha's all over the place.\

` The spacious mansion.@
` While I used to think it was like a giant castle, now it almost seems like an abandoned, haunted house.@
` Because, I've grown up since then.@
` Akiha and I, we're not the Tohno Akiha and Tohno Shiki that we were then.\

` I go outside.@
br
` ---Come to think of it, most of the time we spent playing was in the garden.@
br
` Since Akiha was obedient to that old man, unlike me, she could only play outside for about thirty minutes a day.@
` And still, she usually just stayed behind us, watching and listening.\

` But she would energetically run out with us and compete with us in whatever games we would play.@
br
`"…… Perhaps her personality stems from those times?"@
` She might have suppressed herself in front of that old man.@
` But still, Akiha's changed too much since then.@ Maybe these eight years were a longer time than I thought.\

` ---I go to the courtyard.@
` Outside, the walls are also inscribed with names.@
br
` SHIKI, Shiki, Akiha, SHIKI, Akiha, SHIKI, Akiha, Shiki, Shiki, SHIKI, Shiki.@
br
` The ratios are like that, and the name SHIKI appeared far more times.@
` I suppose Akiha was just a girl so she couldn't keep up with a boy.\

`"Geez.@ It would've been better if I held back a bit."@
` Cursing myself from that time doesn't change the number of my scribbles.@
` If this was the case, I probably made Akiha pretty angry, considering how much she hates losing.@
`"I see.@ Maybe she's taking it out on me now."@
` …… I'm sure she's not the kind to do that, but if she did, that's a little cute.\

`"I'm an older brother stupid for his little sister."@
` Yeah, I really am.@
`"----Well then."@
` With a nostalgic, peaceful feeling, I stroll through the courtyard.\

` Where Hisui headed to, there seems to be a small clearing.@
br
`"……… Huh?@ There's a clearing in that place?"@
` Tilting my head to the side, I try to remember, but for some reason, my memory is a bit vague.@
` In the forest of the mansion, I can see a clearing as if the trees were cut there.\

` ---No, "can see" is not quite right.@
` If you walk by normally, you probably would never notice it.@
` If Hisui didn't walk there, hidden enough by the surrounding trees as it is, I would never have noticed even if I lived here all my life.@
