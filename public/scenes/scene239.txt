` Even after running everywhere in town, there's no sign of Yumizuka Satsuki anywhere.@
br
`"………… Gah."@
` I bite my lip angrily.@
` …… But it's not anger over not finding her.\
` Two days ago.@
` I'm mad at myself for promising such a thing in the first place.\

` There's really nothing I can do.@
br
` She said it hurt.@
` I can't even find Yumizuka, painfully suffering in the cold darkness.\

` The sun is setting.@
` …… I don't want to admit it, but maybe I can only find Yumizuka after nightfall.@

` Perhaps it's too early.@
` I'll go back to the mansion and calmly think this through.\
