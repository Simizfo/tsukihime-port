` I race down the hallway.@
` The heated air and sense of foreboding seem to stretch over the dark of night like glass.@

` ----*pant*, *pant*, *pant*.@

` Breathing heavily, I dash down the hallway.@
` …… My back hurts.@
` This terrible feeling in the air gets heavier as I draw near Akiha's room.\
