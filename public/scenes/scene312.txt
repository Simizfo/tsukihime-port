` Her presence nears.@
` Thump, the sound of my heartbeat.@
` It might be because I can't see anything, this time I easily slip through her grasp.@

`"------No way."@
br
` Yumizuka's surprised voice.@
` I know her back is facing me.@
` But since I can't see her, I can't do anything.@
` From there----a hostile, killing presence growing stronger.\

`"Why you----I said, don't move!!!"@
` Her voice.@ Impending death.@
` I blindly swing my knife to meet them.@

` Saying so, I hate how stupid I am.@
` Why am I worrying over someone trying to kill me----?@

`"…… Back…… alley."@
` It seems I flew all the way to the back alley wall.@
` I feel the hard wall against my back.@

`"Liar----!"@
` Her voice full of hate, she swings her arm towards me.@
`"………………"@
` I can't move.@
` Since I can't move, all I can do is be killed.\

`"……………… Eh?"@
` The wall shakes.@
` Yumizuka's arm only pounded the wall next to me.\

` Like a child throwing a tantrum, she keeps screaming.\

` Bam.@ Bam.@
` Her forlorn, anguished voice.@

` …… How, foolish.@
` Her words weren't ones of hate directed at me.@
` Yumizuka Satsuki was only crying this whole time because she can't help it----\

` ----Her voice dwindles away.@
br
` Only able to move my fingers, I look at her.@
` …… How come?@
` Yumizuka looks at my unmoving body as if she was surprised.@
` …… As if,
` she was waking from a nightmare, and regretting what she's done.\

`"----Shiki-kun, I…… never, meant to----"@
br
` Her voice is trembling.@
` …… I guess she's calmed down, but her voice still sounds like she is about to cry.\

`"……… It's……… okay."@
br
` ----You don't need to blame yourself like that.@
` Even if your mind and body turned into a vampire.@
` In the end, you're still just a pitiful victim.@
` In any case, I can't move.@
` Yumizuka, if you say you are so alone, in so much pain, and so cold,
` then there is only one thing that I can do.\

`"…… It's okay, Yumizuka-san."@
`"Shiki…… kun?"@
`"You can suck my blood if you want.@
` It's a promise…… I'll be with you, okay?"@
` I think my voice was kinder then I ever was.@

` After hesitating, she quietly kneels by me and holds me.\

`"----Is it, really okay?"@
` Her voice is mingled with hesitation and happiness.@
`"…… What?@ You came after me because you wanted to do that, right?@ Why are you hesitating now, Yumizuka-san?"@
`"But------I really want to, but----"@
br
` ----If I do that, I really will be hopeless----
br
` That last line barely escapes her lips.\

`"…………"@
` …… How ironic.@
` Certainly she has become a vampire.@ Yet in her most important part, a human heart remains.@
` Because her heart remains, Yumizuka Satsuki still feels pain over being a vampire.@
` Being human.@
` As long as that part remains human, she will be in pain.\

`"----It hurts, doesn't it?@ So it's okay.@ I can't help you.@ So shouldn't we just do things your way?"@
`"……… Shiki……… kun."@
` She nods.@
` Then, she brings her lips to my neck.\
