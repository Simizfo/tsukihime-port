` ----Hmm.@

` I probably won't ever get a chance to talk with Arcueid in a fast food restaurant in the middle of the day like this again, so I'll ask not about vampires, but something more ordinary.\

`"Then I'll ask you.@ Arcueid, could you tell me a little about your interests, your past, and your three sizes?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"You want to know about that?@ You sure ask strange things, Shiki."@
`"It's not strange.@ I don't know anything about you, so it's natural to want to know about you."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, I feel the same way, perhaps----in that case, I don't mind."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"But, interests and a past… I don't have any of those.@ I've also never measured myself so I can't tell you my three sizes.@ I never recorded my age or my height like you guys do."@
`"What do you mean?@ You've never even wondered about yourself?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, it's not like that, but it wasn't anything I ever had as a priority.@ All I need is the ability to hunt Dead Apostles…… vampires."@
`"But still, there were things that happened before you came to this city, right?@ I want to hear about those kinds of things."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Before I came here…… hmm, that would probably be about eight years ago then.@
` At that time, I wasn't in this country, but in some other country hunting a vampire.@
` A vampire made its lair in a small, French countryside village that became a ghost town.@ After two days, I found the 'enemy' and dealt with the female Dead Apostle controlling the town----"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` As if remembering something horrible, Arcueid closes her eyes and cuts off.\

`"Eight years ago?@ Then up until now, what were you doing, Arcueid?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What was I doing?@ I just went back to my castle and slept.@ My duty is to hunt Dead Apostles.@ I have no other meaning for existence, so until another Dead Apostle stands out, there's nothing to do but continue sleeping, right?"@
`"Wha------"@
` Continue sleeping?@ Does she mean literally?@
` No, in the first place----\

`"…… Wait a minute.@ A castle, you mean that castle?@ I'd have trouble believing it, but don't tell me your place is like that Cinderella's castle…!?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t11.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Cinderella's castle?"@
` Arcueid tilts her head like she doesn't get it.\

`"Uh----no, that's not a really appropriate expression.@ Um, I mean, you're a, um…… princess?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, it seems that way.@ A long time ago I was told not to cut my hair and scolded to act more like royalty."@
`"--------"@
` …… I'm speechless.@
` Come to think of it, that Nrvnqsr guy always called her "princess."@
` But still----\

`"A royal princess?"@
` I steal a glance at Arcueid.@
` She's beautiful enough to take your breath away, but such a rambunctious person a princess?@ She's not quite what comes to mind when I think of a princess.\

`"…… Well, at least you are as selfish as a princess."@
` I give a deep sigh.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey now!@ I only said it because you asked, so don't respond like that!"@
` Her Royal Highness glares at me.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` …… Arcueid doesn't seem to think of herself as a princess either, so I think it's just best to forget about this.\

` Still angry, Arcueid resumes eating her hamburger.@
` After she's finished and calmed down, we decide to go somewhere else.\
