` …… That's right.@
` I've been helping Arcueid look for this "enemy", but I don't even know what kind of guy he is yet.@
br
`"Then I'll ask.@ Arcueid, your 'enemy', what kind of vampire is he?@ You've been chasing him this long, so you know what he looks like, right?"@

`"Well----I----"@
` Arcueid looks away.\

`"What is it?@ Didn't you just say you wouldn't hide anything from me?"@

`"Yes, but please listen without getting angry.@
` I only knew just recently that the vampire in this city was here.@ I came here as soon as I knew the 'enemy' was in this city in this country, but I have never met him.@
` So to be honest, I don't know anything about the 'enemy' this time."@
`"You don't know?----Didn't you recognize Nrvnqsr on sight?"\

`"Nrvnqsr was famous, and he never changed his appearance.@
` While the "enemy" I'm pursuing isn't as strong of a vampire, his traits fall within a broad range and I have no idea of his specialties or features this time.@
` I'm really sorry Shiki---but I really can only tell you this much."@
br
` …… I know she's not lying.@ I know, but still, I feel like she's hiding something.@
` Like----\

`"That's okay.@ You can't help it if you don't know.@
` But----at least you know the name of this 'enemy', right?"@

`"N----name?"@
`"Yeah, his name."@
` She gets downcast, descending into silence.@
` She cannot tell me his name for some reason, and she is troubled.@
br
` Well, that's what I thought, anyway.\

`"----His name."@
` Coldness.@
` Rapidly, I feel a chill so great it seems like it could freeze the entire room.@
br
`"Shiki, his name is……"@
` Arcueid isn't having any trouble saying it.@
br
`"…… His name is Michael.@ Michael Roa Valdamjong.@
` Called Uroboros, a Dead Apostle who used to be human."@
` She speaks while still looking down.@
` Pure enmity, as if she was spitting forth blood.@

`"Arcueid, you----"@
`"------"@
` Her shoulders are shaking.@
` It looks like she's trying to hold herself back from going on a rampage.@
`"…… Sorry.@ I shouldn't have asked.@ It's okay, just forget about it."@
` Arcueid shakes her head slightly.@
` As if trying to say she could never forget.@
br
` A period of silence ensues between us.\


`"------I'm sorry."@
` Arcueid says this, still looking down.@
`"----Mm."@
` I give a noncommittal response.@ Both of us rise automatically from our seats and leave the restaurant.\
