` The moonlight coming in from the window barely sheds enough light to see.@
` In the blue darkness, I see Akiha on the ground.@
`"Akiha----!"@
` I run to her and hold her up.@
`"…………………"@
` Akiha does not move, so she might be unconscious.@ But I can tell she's alive as her small chest rises and falls with her breathing.\

` But, there's something more strange.@
` Akiha's black hair.@ It has turned into a bloody shade of red.@
`"Akiha---you're really Akiha…… right?"@
` …… The hair looks red in the darkness.@
` But, it's definitely Akiha.@
`"Akiha, hey, come on……!@ What happen---"\

` …… A cold chill goes through my spine.@
` I feel death in my nerves.\


` …… The person is just there, broken.@
` Abnormal eyes that seem out of this world.@
` But there is some intelligence.@ It seems the bandaged person has both intelligence and madness.\

` He was with Akiha back then.@ The third kid's name was certainly that.\
