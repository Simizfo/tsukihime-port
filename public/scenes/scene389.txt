` …… I heard that Akiha hasn't returned yet.@
` Which means that if I go to her room, no one will be there.\

` …… I arrive at her room.@
` Akiha's room is in the middle of the east wing.@ My room is about forty meters away, so this a rare opportunity.@
`"-----"@
` I gulp anxiously.@
` …… If I think about it calmly, I'm doing something extremely dangerous.@
`"--I can't go back now!"@
` Making up my mind, I open the door to Akiha's room.\

`"-----"@
` …… I expected this… but still, I'm at a loss for words.@
` I am fascinated by the room that looks nothing like any high schooler's room.@
`"…… There's no bed…… it must be in a separate room."@
` I almost forget myself looking at all the luxury.@
` I thought I'd explore Akiha's room while she isn't here, but this isn't a place where you can come in like that.\

`"…… I better go before Akiha finds me."@
` With a sigh, I turn to leave the room.@

` ---Akiha is standing in front of the door with her arms crossed.\

`"Ah, Akiha----You've come back already……!?"@
`"Yes, I just got back.@ More importantly, Nii-san, is there something you want to talk to me about?@ There has to be, otherwise there would be no reason for you to be in my room alone, now, would there?"@
`"Ah----um."@
` I back up as Akiha glares at me intently.\

`"No, I---it's not really important… I just thought I'd talk with you for a bit---"@
`"Oh really?@ That's strange.@ If you wanted to talk to me, going into my room when I'm not there is rather pointless, isn't it?@ It makes perfect sense that if you saw I was not in my room, you would go back to your room, right?"@
`"That's true, but…… I thought maybe I should just wait a while in your room or maybe I didn't……"@
