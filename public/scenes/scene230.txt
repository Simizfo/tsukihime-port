` I walk through the hallway bathed in sunset with Senpai.@
` While talking about pointless things, we walk as slowly as possible.@
br
` There's such a wonderful atmosphere here.@
` ---Thinking back, I spent the night in Senpai's room.@
` Back then, my mind was filled with the fact that I killed someone, and after that, I forgot about it when I was with Arcueid.\

` …… If it wasn't for that one night, I don't think I would be here today as I am now.@
` She doesn't bring it up, but I wonder what she thinks about that night.@
` …… Did it feel like she was just lending a hand to a depressed lowerclassman?@

` I don't think I can last until dinner, so I should buy some bread on the way back-----\

`"Tohno-kun, here."@
` Senpai presents me a pouch of cloth she is holding.@
` I think it's her lunch.@

`"It's partly eaten, but is that okay?"@
` Blushing a bit, Senpai says this embarrassedly.@
