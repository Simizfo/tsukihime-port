` She looks directly into my eyes coldly.\

`"Look, Shiki.@ Your resistance to death by external means is higher than that of most people.@ That is probably because you've already faced death once before.@

`"Wait a minute.@ I didn't say that person was a woman though."@
`"No, there's no mistake.@ That woman is the only agent given authority to hunt heretics alone and who uses Black Keys that combine the Cremation Rite and the Steel Shell Effect."@

` Even when she spoke about Nrvnqsr, her voice was never saturated with emotion to this extent.\

`"…… Arcueid.@ Um, that person who helped me, is she a vampire……?"@
`"Of course not.@ She's a member of those who see vampires as their enemy.@
` It doesn't exist in this country, but there is an organization that considers vampires or beastmen as heretics and goes around killing them.@ The one who helped you was the most troublesome of that kind, Exorcists.\

`"…… But that's strange.@ The Burial Agency wouldn't have sent an agent this soon."@

` …… You can't kill someone using a cheap notion like justice.@
` People kill to preserve their own life.@
` That's the most primitive, simple logic of the beasts.@
