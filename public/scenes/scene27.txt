` During lunchtime the hall is packed.@
` Students head to the cafeteria or to their favorite places, lunches in hand.@
` Caught in the flow of people, I contemplate whether I should go to the cafeteria or the store.@
`"……"@
` I'm somewhat taken aback at my own leisure.
br
` If I have time to waste, it'd be better to go to the cafeteria where Arihiko is.@
` I begin walking towards the cafeteria.@
` On the way there, a familiar face waves and runs up to me.\

`"Thank goodness!@ I've been looking for you, Tohno-kun."@
`"Oh… Ciel-senpai.@ Hello."@

`"Yes, hello… Well, we've already met once today, so I guess it's not proper to say 'Hello'."@
` A small smile floats onto Senpai's face, as if she found something amusing.@
`"Eh… ah… Yeah, now that you mention it, I guess you're right."@
` I avert my eyes and give a lukewarm reply, becoming increasingly embarrassed.\
br
` ---I wonder.@
` I should be used to speaking to Senpai like this, but for some reason I'm getting embarrassed.\

`"Eh… No, nothing like that…"@

`"…… It's nothing.@ More importantly, Senpai, you said you were looking for me.@ Do you need me for something?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Well, I wanted to thank you for this morning, so I was looking for you."@
`"For this morning… Ah, you mean in the courtyard?"@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Of course.@ Sorry to ask, but are you going to have lunch?"\
` I sigh.@ "Well, people usually eat lunch at lunchtime."@

`"Great!@ Then we can eat together.@ I'll treat you as thanks for this morning.@ Let's go to the cafeteria."@
`"Eh… ?"@
` Senpai smiles.@ Grabbing my wrist, she starts to walk.@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst



` It's strange enough for a third-year like Senpai to walk down the second-year hall, but this attracts even more attention.@
` The gazes of the students in the hall fall upon Senpai and me and a murmur of conversation starts.\

`"Wa… wait just a second!@ It's all right, you don't have to…!"@
` I quickly shake her off my arm.@
`"I only did what I did this morning on a whim.@ There's no need for you to thank me."@
` I draw back from Senpai, well aware of how flushed my face is.\

`"Come on, there won't be any seats left if we don't hurry.@ I'll listen to the details after we get to the cafeteria."@

` Senpai starts walking, pulling my arm with a tug.\

`"……"@
` Any further questions would bring more stares from the people around us in the hall.@

` Almost all the seats in the cafeteria are taken.@

` So empty cafeteria seats are pretty much nonexistent.\

` It seems my only choice is to obediently accept that she'll be treating me.\

`"…… But there aren't any seats left."@
` I look around the bustling cafeteria.@
` You can't find even two seats at this hour, let alone two seats togeth---there.@
br
` I sigh.@
` There, plain as day, is a table with not only two, not three, but four unoccupied seats.@
` There's only one student sitting at the table, and it seems he noticed me while I was looking around for a seat.\

`"Yo, Tohno!"@
` The student vigorously waving his hand is my dear classmate with the dyed orange hair.@
`"……"@
` My head hurts.@
` But there isn't anywhere else to sit; I have no choice but to return the wave and walk towards the table where my friend is sitting.\

` Arihiko begins to complain as soon as we are face to face.@
`"Yeah, come to think of it, you did.@ So, who is it?"@
`"Huh… about that… She promised me yesterday she'd come, but she declined this morning.@ She said she has someone she wanted to thank or something, so she'd be busy this lunchtime."@

`"Here you go, Tohno-kun.@ Please, eat until you're full!"@
` Even after all this time, I still can't shake off her smile.@
`"Ah… all right.@ In that case, thanks for the food."@
` …… Taking Arihiko's dumbfounded stare in stride, I sit down.@
` Senpai sits in front of me while Arihiko sits beside me.\

`"Itadakimasu."@
` Putting my hands together with a clap, I look down at the tray Senpai brought.@
br
` And on the menu is: Curry Rice, Curry Rice, and Curry Udon.@
`"……"@
` I don't get it.\

`"Yes?@ What is it, Tohno-kun?"@
`"Uh… about this… what's going on?"@

`"'What else', you say… but all I see is curry."@

`"Yes, it's curry."@
` Senpai laughs happily.@
` …… The problem is, they all look like curry.\

`"…… There's three dishes."@

`"Of course.@ You're a boy, so you eat a lot.@ I'll have just one, so please take whatever you like."@

` The other choice is hell.@

`"Make sure to finish it, Tohno-kun.@ After all, you aren't picky with food, are you?"@
`"……"@
` There isn't a shred of antagonism in Senpai's smile, nor is this some kind of a joke.@
` She truly had good intentions.\

` I dig into the curry rice with my spoon in despair.@
br
` ---And then,

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Tohno-kun!"@
` From beside me came the cry of a dead man being reborn.@
`"How long are you going to ignore your dear best friend!?"@
` Arihiko's elbow sinks into the side of my stomach with a thud.\

`"Eh…?@ Inui-kun, do you know Tohno-kun?"@
`"Do I know him?@ We've been best friends since middle school!"@
` My best friend hits the table with a bang for emphasis.@
`"Really?@ The person who helped me this morning was Tohno-kun."@
`"Oh yeah?@ If you had told me his name, I would have brought him here… So, did this guy do something for you?"@
`"Yes, he helped me fix my splints."@

` Arihiko frowns suspiciously.@
` …… Well, I guess you would consider helping someone fix their shin splints a bit odd.\

`"No, fixing splints.@ Please don't make me angry when I am eating."@
` Ciel-senpai gets angry.@

`"Fixing splints…?@ Ah, the splints in the courtyard!@ You were at it again?@ You sure enjoy that kind of thing, Senpai, but you'd be better off if you gave up.@ If you keep doing things like that, the teachers will start expecting you to do them."@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah.@ Didn't you know, Tohno?@ Ciel-senpai is so handy they call her the 'Shadow President' of the student council."@
`"No, I was asking Senpai.@ Wait, never mind… what on earth is the 'Shadow President'?"@
` "Is she strong?" I ask with my eyes.@
` "Yeah," responds Arihiko with an exaggerated nod.\


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"She's quite something, totally unlike the Student Council, which is the student council in name only.@
` She's a third-year who'll solve anything for you if you ask her.@ Even got a fan club among the first years!@ And if something happens, the teachers all rely on her.@ There isn't a single teacher who complains about what Senpai does."@
` Arihiko speaks with pride as if he was actually talking about himself.@

`"Wow… Ciel-senpai sure is amazing.@ Even the teachers rely on you."@
` I look at Senpai, impressed.\

`"Ah, yes.@ Uh… thank you."@
` Senpai turns bright red, embarrassed.@


cl a,%type_crossfade_fst


` Senpai churns her curry rice with her spoon.@
` I guess it's to hide her embarrassment, but it reminds me of the enemy I have to face.@
` Curry rice by itself is fine, but after that awaits curry udon.@
` My doctor warned me not to eat too much, but I don't think there's anything else in this situation that I can do.@ So I start to dig in to the rice.\

` *munch* *munch*@
` Having decided to try to finish one dish quickly, I direct all my concentration to the rice.@
br
` Meanwhile, Senpai and Arihiko began talking about their own homes for some reason.@
` I already know that Arihiko doesn't live with his parents, but it seems Senpai is also living by herself.@
` Apparently, Senpai's apartment is quite close to school.@ It's roughly between the main street and the park.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Hmmm… So, Tohno-kun, where do you live?"@
`"Huh?"@
` I silently eat my food when Senpai, peering at me, asks a completely unrelated question.@
`"Where…?@ Why do you ask, Senpai?"\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"You already heard where I live, right, Tohno-kun?@ I think it's unfair if I don't know where your house is."@
`"Unfair?@ You worry about the strangest things, Senpai."\
`"It's not strange.@ If I don't know where you live, I can't visit you if something happens, right?"@
` I stop eating the curry rice.@
` I have the feeling that something has been said that I should be jubilant about.@
`"Eh… Visit?@ You mean you'd come and visit me if I catch a cold or something?"@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"No, I wouldn't.@ I don't have any plans to visit at the moment."@
` Smiling, Senpai replies instantly, as if stating the obvious.\

`"……"@
` It seems like the euphoria is premature.@ Senpai doesn't seem to have any unusual intentions.@
br
` I see now… that's just the way she is.\

`"…… I guess I have to tell you.@
` Yeah, my house is nearby too, only a forty minute walk.@ There's a residential district on top of the hill, right?@ Just go a little further and you're there."@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Oh yeah.@ You're moving today, right?"@
` Arihiko strikes his hand on the desk.@
` Senpai tilts her head slightly.@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Moving?@ Tohno-kun, were you a transfer student?"@
`"Huh?"@
` Senpai asks a strange question.@
` Arihiko meets my gaze.\


cl r,%type_crossfade_fst




`"Uh, listen… I've been here since the first year.@ We've known each other since then, right?@ Why are you asking if I'm a transfer student now?"@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"But Tohno-kun, you moved yesterday, so--"@
`"Moving doesn't automatically make you a transfer student.@ I'm just changing my address, not my school.@ Until now, I've been living with some relatives in the neighboring town.@ I'm just going back to my real home, that's all."@
` Senpai, who wears a look of surprise, seems to understand.\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"I see, you've only changed your residence.@ So, now you live in the outskirts of town."@
`"Yeah.@ It's that colorful place on top of the hill… I'm moving there today."@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Haah… could that possibly be the Tohno-san mansion?" Senpai asks with some hesitation.@
` The western-style house at the top of the hill is probably seen as something special by residents of this town.@
` I haven't been there for eight years, but even in my memories, the Tohno mansion was ridiculously large.\
`"Yeah, that's right.@ I don't think it's the right place for me either, but it's too late now that I'm done moving."@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Hmm… You don't seem too happy about it."@
`"It's neither good nor bad.@ I don't quite understand it either."@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Well, even if it is your house, it's been eight years, right?@ I can understand if you're feeling strange.@ It'll probably feel like someone else's house for a while."@
`"I wonder if that's so… I haven't gone back yet, so I don't know.@ Well, I'm a bit relaxed, since I've always got a refuge at your place."\


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Yeah, right.@ My house is no refuge of yours.@ When you come over during the holidays, my sister treats you better than me!"@
`"……"@
` That's probably only because Arihiko has terrible behavior, but I refrain from telling him that in the interests of preventing the conversation from getting any worse.@
br
` ---To be honest, it's not pleasant to have my home raised as a topic of conversation.\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Wow… You two certainly get along well." Senpai peers at Arihiko and me.@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"No way!@ Me and Tohno would never help each other, no matter how much trouble we were in.@ In other words, we're enemies, mademoiselle."@

`"But your relationship is so good that Tohno-kun has stayed over at your house before, right?@ Doesn't that mean you get along really well?"@

`"You're wrong, Senpai.@ That damn Tohno is too reserved toward his parents, and he'd come over to my place every vacation.@ He's reserved toward them 'cause they're taking care of him.@
` That's why he comes over to my place, where we conveniently have an empty room.@ Since he looks pretty decent, my sister took a liking to him, and he shamelessly comes to stay with us without paying a cent!"@

`"I'm sorry, Tohno-kun.@ Um… did you not get along with your previous family?"@
`"No, that's not it.@ He has no problem with the Arimas.@ Oh, the Arimas were the family who took care of him.@ They're really nice people, and from what I could tell, they're a happy family.@
` Even so, he refused to be their adopted kid, and he escaped to my place every vacation.@ Sheesh… just what were you not satisfied with, anyway?"\
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
