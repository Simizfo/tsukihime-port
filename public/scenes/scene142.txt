` …… When I heard that before, it kind of stuck in my head, I thought it was a little odd.@ So what exactly do you mean by those who weren't originally vampires?"\

`"Simple, I'm just saying that Dead Apostles used to be humans.@ They either gained immortality through magic or became servants of the True Ancestors that sucked their blood.@

`"That's true, but things get complex from here.@
` The people who have their blood sucked die.@ But at that time, if the Dead Apostles place a little of their blood inside the corpse, the body cannot die.@

`"…… Arcueid.@ Um, can I ask a question?@ This 'enemy' you speak of, is he strong?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well, he should be many times superior to The Dead earlier.@ I haven't met him this time, but he has been latent for eight years so maybe he's a Class Five by now."@
`"---You're saying he's stronger than The Dead before?"@
` Looking like she was in so much pain from fighting just him, isn't she taking him a little lightly?\

`"…… Class Five?@ I don't get it, but does that mean he's stronger than Nrvnqsr?"@
`"Not a chance.@ Nrvnqsr was special.@ He was a pure, supreme vampire that would be difficult to defeat even with my full power.@ Compared to him, this enemy is pretty weak."\
`"----Oh.@ Then there's no way you'll be defeated."@
` I breathe out in relief.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Hm, who knows?@ A few days earlier and he wouldn't be a problem, but now I'm just recovering.@ The possibility that he has more power is actually high."@
`"…… Recovering?@ Are you sick or something, Arcueid?"@
`"Yeah, I still have the effects from when you killed me and I don't think I'll be fine for at least a few more days."@
`"----Ah."@

cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` That's right--the reason why Arcueid is weak… it isn't anyone's fault but mine.\

` Arcueid lightly touches her side.@

`"It seems the wounds don't heal like usual.@ I could manage the outside, but I can't seem to heal the inside."@

` ---That wound as well.@
` The one she received to save me.\

`"U-----"@
` I'm at a loss for words.@
` It's completely my fault she's in that position.@
br
` So why?@
` Why doesn't she hold it against me?@ Why does she just give that innocent smile---?\

`"…… You need to stop.@ Until you heal up, you should just rest.@ If you take a day or two off, things won't be that bad, so---"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's no good.@ Thanks to Nrvnqsr coming, 'the enemy' knows I'm here.@ If I rest, that's like telling him I'm weakened."\

`"So you're saying you're going to keep on going like this?"@
`"Yes.@ Since I don't know where 'the enemy's' lair is, I have to keep destroying his blood supply.@
` If I cut that off, it will force him to come out."\

cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

`"---Arcueid.@ What if that's tomorrow?@ Wouldn't you be killed instead……!?@ Then---"@
` I want to tell her to stop, but I halt mid-sentence.@
br
` Like Arcueid says--if 'the enemy' sees that weakness, Arcueid might be killed.@
` More than anything else, I learned from the past four days.@
` Arcueid isn't someone to stop half-way once she's decided to do something, no matter how much it hurts.\

`"Damn----"@
` Arcueid won't stop.@
` If I leave her alone---she probably won't even be able to talk like this anymore.@
` It makes me mad, but she's not even afraid of her own death.\

`"…… Is that so?"@
` …… Why does she smile like that?@
` If she doesn't smile like that---If she acted more like a real vampire, I wouldn't have to feel like this.\

\

`"…… Damn………… it."@
` …… I don't want to lose her.@
` I don't know what this feeling is.@
` But these past four days are not something I can just forget about.@
` So---to part here, with the possibility she may die tomorrow, the regret would be completely, utterly, unbearably---difficult.\

`"…… Give me a break.@ My eyes are already broken, but my heart's going to break as well."@
br
` Arcueid is a vampire, and I don't want to be involved in something like that again.@
` I remember the fight with Nrvnqsr.@
` Just thinking about it sends chills down my spine.@ The fear of being one step away from death still remains.\

` This is the same.@
` Definitely, the opponent this time isn't normal.@
` There's really no need for me to be involved.@
` Since Arcueid is saying she'll handle it, I can rely on her.@
` But even knowing all of that.@

` …… I can't, I just can't leave her alone.\

`"Yeah, I'm not!@ If I was acting normal, I really wouldn't say this……!"@
` I spit.@

`"-----Eh?"@
` Arcueid looks at me in total surprise.@
` As for me, finally saying it kind of calms me down.\

`"…………"@
` I groan.@

`"Hurry.@ I want to hear those words again."@
` Arcueid asks softly.@
` Looking off in the distance, I try to sound reluctant.@
`"…… I guess it can't be helped.@ It's my fault that you are weakened now and I can't leave the monster roaming the streets alone either.@
` I can't rely on you taking care of it by yourself, so if you let me, I want to help you… that's what I said."\

`"Shiki----!"@
` Arcueid's eyes are suddenly alight.@
` She grabs my hand and happily shakes it up and down.@

`"But, what do we do now?@ Do you want to search for more of The Dead like before?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yeah, I think that's all we can do for now.@ The one before was the twelfth, so I don't think there's many more.@ The parent vampire will have to come out once they all are destroyed, so we have to hunt the remaining ones for now.@
` Is that still okay?", she asks.\

`"Anything is fine, I'm just with you.@ If you lead, then I'll follow.@ --well, shall we start again?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, no, that's good for tonight.@ They usually follow a fixed route, and the other Dead will probably not be out tonight.@
` Since they are fewer in number, I don't think he'll let them all come out at once."@
`"---Oh really?@ But, doesn't that mean this 'enemy' will try to hide The Dead from you, Arcueid?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Basically.@ But since this 'enemy' is a vampire, he needs to steal the blood and energy of others.@
` So, even though he knows I'm searching for them, he has to send The Dead out to get the minimal blood he needs."@
br
` ---*sigh*@
` Then, the minimal Dead he sent out was that man from before, huh.\
br
`"So, searching further tonight will be useless, I think."\

`"…… Well, I don't mind.@ But it is tedious though."@
`"Yeah, hunting vampires is tedious work.@ We have to find the coffin of this 'enemy' somewhere in this city, so it won't be easy."@
