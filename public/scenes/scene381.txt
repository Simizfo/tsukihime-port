` But I do know that I can't leave Akiha alone.@
`"-------!!"@
` I kill the flood of emotions.@
` Without thinking, I go after Akiha.\

` --To my surprise, Akiha has not gone beyond the mansion.@
br
` Under the moonlight.@
` Under the autumn leaved tree we once talked under.@
` Akiha just stands there.\

` She is standing quietly.@
` Not doing anything.@
` Like a child, she innocently stares at the falling autumn leaves.\

`"--------"@
` What---could I do about it?@
` No reason, no intelligence, a girl that's just there.@
` There's no crime.@
` Akiha is not the one to blame…
br
` -----Please kill me.@
br
` I recall those words.\

` ---Please kill me with your hands.@
br
` What a cruel wish.@
` She could only ask for that---she couldn't even ask for help.@
` If you asked---I would have been on your side until the very last moment, even if the whole world was against me.@
br
` ---Please keep our promise.@
br
` …… What severe treatment.@
` I did leave her for eight years, but I never thought I'd be retaliated against in such a way.\

` Akiha said…
` Not knowing who you are and going around killing people out of instinct is more frightening than death.\

` Senpai said…
` If you become something that just kills because of instinct, sometimes death is the only salvation.\

`"--------"@
` I grip my knife.@
` Surprisingly, I feel no sadness.@
` It's like my mind has gone empty; I don't want to feel any emotions.@
`"Akiha---"@
` I step on the dead autumn leaves as I walk towards her.@
` Akiha notices me and greets me with a smile.\

`"-----At least."@
` I grip hard onto my knife.@
` Akiha laughs.@
` She laughs happily as she greets the person that will kill her.@
`"-------!!"@
` My mind weakens.@
` But I have started walking.\

` ---Death can be salvation.@
br
` I walk.@
` Akiha does not run away, but waits for me happily.@
br
` ----Please kill me.@
br
` The autumn leaves fall.@
br
` ---That was your last wish.\

` Akiha is laughing.@
` There's no more distance to cross.@
` Now all I have to do is stick out this arm.@
br
` ----No matter how painful it is for me,
br
`"I have to kill you."@

br
` Saying that,
` my eyes suddenly overflow with tears.\
