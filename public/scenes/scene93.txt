br
` Instead of running towards me, the beasts beneath the emergency light are heading towards the elevator I was just in--towards the sound of footsteps.@
br
` Ahead of the animals, I can hear what sounds like a kitchen knife slicing vegetables.@
` Something--a human silhouette is slashing the black animals--\

`"-----?"@
` But I don't have time to discern its identity.@
` Using my hands and feet, I rush up the fire stairs like a dog.\

` But here, there is no trace of that stench.@
` That raw stench of beasts, blood, and entrails.@
`"Haa----aah."@
` I manage to get up, and tracing along the wall, I walk back towards Arcueid's room.\

`"Ha------"@

` Red flecks are all over me.@ My arm and chest, even my face.\

`"Haha------"@

` At that point,
` there was no longer anyone else still alive.\

` This---and that and this and that… all of it has been the work of the "enemy" Arcueid was talking about-----!?\

` My teeth grind together.@
` They clench together so tightly it feels like they're going to shatter.@
` My body is still trembling.@
` My consciousness is still numb.@
` But more than all of that---I can't accept that spectacle.\

` What was that just then?@
` What, all those incomprehensible animals devoured all the guests staying on the lower floors?@
` Had they all been killed and eaten?@
` One-sidedly, pointlessly killed without a chance to argue, escape, or even call for help…!?\

`"You've got to be kiddi--"@

` I clench the knife tightly.@
` And then.@
` With a cheerful electronic "ding!", the elevator which stopped on the tenth floor reaches this one.\

br
` The door opens.@
` Within---are two black dogs.\

` The black dogs are coming for me.@

br
` ----Without hesitating.@
br
` First, I stab the dog that leaps at me in the forehead.@
` The black dog falls to the floor without even giving a scream.@
` It melts into a black liquid.\

` After that,
` the other black dog bounds towards me.\

` It don't even take two seconds to cover the ten meters down the hallway.\

`"Kuh----!"@

` I line up the knife again, but not quickly enough.@
` The black dog opens his mouth.@
` That mouth is filled with fangs so many times sharper than the knife I have, and they are aimed straight at my throat.\
` Accurate, and fast.@
` The instant I realize they are drawing upon me,
` the fangs bite into my throat with a crunch.@
br
` I die.\

br
` I thrust my knife into the forehead of the black dog biting into my neck.@
` My arm moved just before the black dog ripped through my throat.\

` It was done rather perfectly, even for myself.@
` Like a machine whose sole function is to cut, I plunged the knife into the dog's forehead without any useless or wasted movement.@
` Because that is where the first dog's "point" was.@
` Normally, even if the brain is destroyed, the muscles try to execute the commands they have received from the brain.@
` The black dog would have probably ripped through my throat even if I had simply pierced its head.\

br

br

` Well--normally, that would happen.\

` But the black dog is "dead".@
` Death is a complete stoppage.@ At the point when I killed it, it lost every form of validity.\

` Right beside me lie the corpses of the two black dogs.@
` One of my arms is covered in blood, the other clutches a red knife.@

` But he doesn't react at all as he walks towards me.@
` It's as if he doesn't notice me at all.\

` The distance between us shrinks.@
` Just a little more---when there is barely one meter between us, the man finally seem to notice me.@

` The instant I see those eyes which no human should possess, I lose all freedom to move my body.\

`"I thought I killed everyone, but it seems like there's still someone left."@
` The man turns and looks at the corpses of the two black dogs.@
`"--You pieces of filth.@ If you can't even take care of a scrap of meat, you're unworthy to be a part of my body."@

` The man voices his displeasure as he raises his hand.@
` His coat lifts like a mantle.@
br
` ---Something's odd.@
` With a splash, the black dogs' remains liquify and disappear into the man's coat.\

`"Ah----"@
` I can't even scream.@
` Below the man's coat is pure darkness, without even the traces of an outline.@
` All that exists there is a mud-like darkness.@
`"Th----"@

` This is dangerous.@
` This guy is just too dangerous----
` My instincts sound the alarm wildly in my head, but I can't even lift a finger.\

` The man in the black coat approaches me.@

` The unstopping headache grows to an unbearable level, telling me this place is dangerous.@
` Whatever the means, if I don't get out of here soon, I am going to lose my life.@
br
` ----But it's too late.@
br
` The man is right before me.@
` Those eyes aren't looking at me at all.\

`"Feed."@
` He raises one of his arms.@
` Below it lies a chaotic darkness.@
` From there, something huge appears.@
br
` Whomp.@
` The sound of wind.@
` That which has appeared from below the man's coat is a crocodile's mouth, easily large enough to swallow a man whole.\

`"Ah------"@

` But it's a futile act.@

` There is a squishing sound.@
