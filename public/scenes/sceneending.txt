` ------Suddenly, I wake up.\

bg "image\bg\ima_21.jpg",crossfade_fst



` A vast night.@
` In the midst of a grassy field that extends as far as the eye can see, I stare blankly at the moon.@
` There is no one else here.@
` No signs of human presence; no sounds from any animals.@
` Maybe it's because I've pushed myself too hard these past couple of days.@
` I just wanted to lie down quietly and be alone, but it seems I fell asleep.\


` It was a bright darkness.@
` Probably because the moon is hanging so low.@
` The grassy field that looked like a black sea last night is bright, like some sort of a stage.@
` A clearing illuminated by sharp, sharp moonlight.@
br
` I thought it was like a theater somewhere.@
br
` Only, there are no curtains around.@
` This field that sweeps far and wide is devoid of any curtains of trees, nor is there an audience or stage crew.\


` There's nothing here.@
` The only things here are the moonlight and the white darkness.@
` The wind does not blow and the grass does not even sway.@
!w1000
br
` ----How quiet.@
br
` I laugh quietly as it feels like all the commotion until yesterday was just a joke.@
` No, if you talk about jokes,
` then my life until now was so happy that, looking back at it, it seems like it was just an illusion.\


` A lot of things have happened.@
` There were a lot of amazing things that occurred, and my life changed pace quite often.@

` The expected, and the unexpected.@
br
` Everything was illusory.@
` Looking back, it seems that no matter how trivial things seemed, all those coincidences built on each other.@
` The days were only a repetition of each other, but no two days were quite the same.@
` Then, that means…
` Perhaps each and every one of them was an irreplaceable moment I can never return to.\


` I recall many things that happened.@
` The memories are so nostalgic, it makes me smile.@
` Just the thought of the new experiences awaiting me in the future, different from those of my past, makes me dizzy.@
br
` Truly a mix of emotions.@ Happiness, excitement, and enough worries to give me a headache.@
br

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",crossfade_fst

` ------Thump.@
br
` My heart beats loudly once.\


` What comes after is my usual anemia.@
` The dizziness continues for a while, but eventually disappears.\

` Even though the wound on my chest healed, my anemia didn't go away.@
` It seems like my fragile health wasn't caused by the wound on my chest alone.@
br
` …… Well, of course.@
` Being able to perceive the shape of death means I stand much closer to death than others.@
` To be honest, I never thought about living a long life, like ordinary people.\


` Thump.@ The sound of my heart beating.@
` It's not like me to think of this, but I wonder just how long I can keep running through time.@
` The conclusion is rather uninteresting.@
br
` Because, even if it stops tomorrow, or in a few decades, still----\

`"Hey you.@ It's dangerous just lying around like that."@
br
` ----And.@
br
` I hear a familiar voice.\

`"Eh…?"@
`"What do you mean, 'eh'?@ You have an awful lot of free time on your hands if you can just sleep around here in the middle of the night.@ I was this close to kicking you, so you better watch out."@
` She says this grumpily while carrying a trunk in one hand.\

`"Oh…?@ Kicked?@ And by who?"@
` I lift myself up.@
`"Isn't it obvious, stupid?@ You and I are the only ones here, so who else could it be but me?"@
` She declares this confidently as she folds her arms.@
`"Ha-------"@
` Stifling the laughter spilling out of me, I gaze up at her and the moon.\

`"I can't believe it… I somehow felt that I'd meet you, but I didn't think that day would be today."@
`"What a coincidence.@ I didn't expect to see you here, either.@
` I heard you were here, but we never did meet up, did we?@ So I was thinking that it was our fate this time not to meet.@ Although…"@
`"If we did see each other, it would have caused trouble, right?"@
`"Right.@ I am a member of the Association, after all.@ We're not quite on good terms with The Church."@
` She laughs without any hint of guilt.@
` It really is hard holding back my laughter.@
` It makes me happy that this person hasn't changed one bit since that day we met.\

`"And, since I ran out of things to do, I was going to leave here tomorrow.@
` See, this incident was partially my fault, you know?@ So, I stopped by here for a final check, and I almost ended up kicking some ordinary person."@
`"Then… we were fated to meet.@ To be honest, I felt we would meet up again."@
` I smile.@
`"You're right.@ I welcome this sort of fate."@
` She flashes me an identical smile in return.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
`"Long time no see.@ You've grown up, Shiki."@
`"Yes.@ You seem to be doing well too, Sensei."@

` Returning her plain greeting, I look back at Sensei with serious eyes.\

` We sit in the field of grass and talk.@
` We talk about senseless things, just like the old days.@
` It was only briefly that we talked about what had happened and what we were going to do in the future.\

`"It's about time.@ I don't plan on staying here long.@ I'm leaving before dawn, so we'll have to part here."@
` Saying that, Sensei stands up.@
` I try to stand up with her… but I collapse.\

`"…… Shiki?"@
` I can hear her voice.@
` I take a few deep breaths and stand back up.@
`"…… Dang.@ It seems like no sleep or rest until last night just hit me."@
`"Looks like it.@ That dizziness is your biggest weakness.@
` You don't look like you have any injuries.@ Is your body alright?"@
`"Yeah, thanks.@ Unlike you, I have a normal body."@
`"Hmm… If you say so."@
` She glances at me meaningfully, then looks directly into my eyes.\


`"----Shiki… You know you're not going to last much longer?"@
br
` Her clear words.@
`"---------"@
` I'm surprised.@
` It's not that I'm surprised by her words, but rather, I never thought she would say them.\

`"----Well, yeah… I kind of know about it already."@
`"Is that so?@ But you seem pretty calm.@
` Even now, you strain your body over something that has nothing to do with you.@
` I would have a hard time believing it, but are you really not afraid of dying?"@
` She stares at me, somewhat peeved.\

`"No way.@ I think I'm more afraid of death than most people."@
br
` But… that's something in the future.@
` It may be tomorrow or next year, but I can't think about the future too much.@
br
`"I can't think about the future too much.@ I prioritize what I want to be doing now."\


`"I see, so you can see your own death as well.@ That's why you're more afraid of death than others.@
` That makes sense… Even for me, I'd be shivering if I could see the thirteen steps to the gallows."@
`"No, it's not like that.@ It's not like I can clearly sense when I'll die."\

`"It's almost the same thing.@ Let's see… can I ask you something, for reference?@
` You ended up with a body weaker than those of others.@ It would only be natural to curse it and fear your life.@
` Hey, Shiki.@ Don't you find it difficult living life with such a body?"@
` Sensei looks at me openly, yet with unreadable eyes.@
` Those are the eyes of a magus, her side of which I'm not familiar with.\

`"---Isn't that right…?@ You can no longer have 'normal' happiness like everyone else.@ As long as you have that body of yours, all that awaits is suffering."@
`"-----That may be so… but…"@
` I think it's not that bad.@
`"But, I'm probably happy.@
` Because up until now was a lot of fun.@ So, it'll probably be fun in the future, too."@
`"-------------"@
` The sound of her gasping.@
` With a large sigh, she changes back to her usual self.\

`"Shiki."@
` She seems sad as she calls my name.@
`"To be honest, I do feel some regret.@
` I feel like I said something to you that I shouldn't have back then."@
` I look straight into her eyes.@
` It's different from before… Back then I had to look up to see her eyes, but now she is looking up into mine.\

`"God doesn't give excessive power without reason.@ And I told you that if you have that power, there has to be some meaning to it.@
` But, you know, it's up to the individual to decide what that meaning may be.@ There's no room for anyone else, especially something as ambiguous as a god, to interfere.@
` So it would have been alright if you did nothing.@
` Even if you denied those eyes of yours and did nothing, it still would have been alright.@
` I'm regretting my words, because… you could have lead a normal life more suitable for you, as Shiki."@
`"……………… Sensei."\

`"Didn't I tell you earlier that you should live your life with an honest heart?@ You really did, Shiki.@
` But, that's something difficult to do.@
` It would have been easier for you to stray from your path a little, because your eyes draw you to disaster.@
` …… Isn't it ironic that a killer more skilled than anyone else also hates killing more than anyone else?@
` If you lived a normal life, or had your heart deviated from the true path, you wouldn't have had to go through so much pain."\

`"Yeah… that may be true, now that you mention it.@ If I gave up, it may have been a little easier.@
` But, that has no meaning.@ It would have only made things a little easier, and to start out with, I never thought of it as particularly painful.@
` You have the wrong idea, Sensei.@ Everything I did, I did because I wanted to.@ It's not like I'm a saint or anything.@
` I like myself just the way I am.@
` That's why… I was glad that you told me back then to become an adult by living just the way I was.@
` Sensei.@ I don't regret anything, so there's no reason for you to regret anything either."\


` I really feel that from the bottom of my heart, and I smile at her.@
` As if dazzled by a radiant light, she narrows her eyes, then closes them briefly.\

`"-----I see……
` Man, it seems you really have become a wonderful young fellow."@
` Her hand reaches for her trunk.\

`"Yeah, you're fine just the way you are, Shiki.@
` …… My world is full of devious individuals, so associating with someone like you balances things out.@ It might be hard on you, but if you don't mind, then I guess it's alright."@
br
` With a "see you," Sensei turns her back to me.\

`"-------------"@
` I can't stop her, and there's no reason to.@
` I can feel that this really is the last time.@
` …… All I can remember is the one thing I forgot to say.@
br
` That day.@
` In an ocean of grass, an important friend who had spoken with me, who was about to disappear.\

`"-------------"@
` There's no wind.@
` The grass does not sway and the only thing that changes is her figure, which gets farther away.@
` She didn't turn around suddenly back then, and she won't now.\

`"------Sensei."@
br
` I call out to stop her.@
` She halts in her tracks.@
`"What?"@
` She doesn't turn around.@ Only her voice drifts to me.\

`"-------------"@
` I know what I must say.@
` The words I've always wanted to say.@
` It's just that… if I say these words, I really won't be able to see her ever again.@
` But still---I have to say them.\

` She told me, "All I'm saying is live true to yourself, and become a man in the manner that you think is right."@
` She also taught me that it is important to accept my mistakes, and to be able to apologize for them.\

` That's why.@
` That's why I have to say it.@
br
br
br
br
`"----Thank you.@ I'm glad I met you, Sensei."\

` …… That's what I felt as a child.@
` Those words were the ones from the bottom of my heart that I once could not say, because I was filled with the sadness of parting.\



` From behind, it seems Sensei is surprised.@
` She stands there, lowers her head, and turns toward me with her usual expression.\
