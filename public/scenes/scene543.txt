` You have reached Akiha's Normal Ending.@ Well done.@
br
` Each heroine (with one exception) has two different kinds of endings.@
` Usually, they are called "True Ending" and "Good Ending", but Akiha-san's are called "Normal Ending" and "True Ending".@
br
` Akiha-san's route is different from everyone else's in that how much Akiha-san likes you does not determine which ending you receive.\


` Well then, thank you very much for playing up to this point.@
br
` Let's meet again somewhere in Tsukihime.\
