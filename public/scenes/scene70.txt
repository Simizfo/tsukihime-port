` ---When I come to, it's morning.@
` Maybe the rain stopped; I can't hear it anymore.@
` It seems clouded outside, and the sunlight through the window is dim.@
br
`"Ha----ah."@
br
` Taking a deep breath, I get out of bed.@
` …… I didn't sleep well last night.@
` Over and over, as I was about to fall asleep, that scene would replay in my mind and keep me awake.\
`"…… A crimson floor and limbs everywhere…"@
` Reason and memory are liabilities at times like these.@
` They force me to remember things I only want to forget.\

`"It's just a dream---why am I so bothered by it?"@
` …… Yes.@ Just a dream.@
` I should forget it quickly, without a moment's delay.@
br
` Knock, knock.@
br
` Someone knocks on the door.@
` It's past six o'clock in the morning.@
` …… Who could it be this early?\

`"Shiki---sama, are you awake?"@
`"Yeah, I've been sleeping since yesterday afternoon, so I'm awake early.@ So, what about you, Hisui?@ What's happening at this time in the morning?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"…………"@
` Hisui falls silent.@
` Actually, now that I look carefully, I notice she has my school uniform in her hands.@
`"I see.@ You brought me a change of clothes."@
`"…… Yes.@ I am sorry.@ I have shown you something you do not wish to see."@
`"?"@
` Hisui keeps silent.@
` …… What is it I didn't want to see?@ I don't get it at all.\
`"…… I don't understand, but thanks anyway.@ Just leave the clothes there.@ I'll get changed soon and go to the sitting room."@
` Hisui nods in assent.@
`"Very well, then.@ Please excuse me."@

` Hisui begins walking silently, only to suddenly turn around.@

`"Shiki-sama.@ …… Um… if you have the time, I will also prepare a bath for you."@
`"…… A bath?@ In the morning?"@
`"Yes.@ You are terribly dirty, Shiki-sama.@ Would it not be best for you to wash before you go to school?"@
` Hisui asks me with her usual lack of expression in a disinterested voice.\
` …… Now that she mentions it, I am dirty.@
` I did collapse from anemia in the park yesterday, after all.@ So, it's not unnatural.@
br
`"---Yeah, would you mind doing that for me?@ I'll have time for that before I go to school if it's this early."@
`"I understand.@ Please come to the bathroom in about twenty minutes."\

` Hisui sets my uniform down and leaves the room.@
br
` It's still six o'clock in the morning.@
` With nothing to do, I spend the twenty minutes in my room staring at the ceiling.\

` I enter the bath and pour water over my head, which makes me feel a little refreshed.@ I take a deep breath as the cold water soaks my hair.@
br
` …… What a terrible dream.@
` There's got to be something wrong with me, having a dream where I kill a beautiful woman like that.@
` If just one day of living in an unfamiliar mansion is enough to give me dreams like that, I hate to think what the days ahead are going to be like.\
` *sigh*@
`"I've really got to get it together."@
` I clear my head with another splash of cold water and wash myself.@
`"Ow……"@
` I feel a sting as the towel touches my throat.@
`"…… What's this?"@
` I look at my neck in the mirror.@
` …… How did this happen?@
` My throat is red and swollen.@
` It's almost as if I injured it by repeatedly throwing up.\

` I return to my room and change into my uniform.@
` It's barely seven o'clock.@
` Astounded at how much clearer my head feels after the bath, I pick up my bag and leave the room.\

`"Good morning, Shiki-san.@ You sure are early today."@
` Kohaku-san makes a bow while smiling.@
`"And you look refreshed, too.@ Have you just had a bath?"@
`"Yeah, I just took one.@ That's amazing, Kohaku-san.@ Can you tell?"\
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Aha, I can tell just by looking at you because your hair isn't dry, Shiki-san.@ You certainly look cuter after you've had a bath."@
` I avert my gaze just a little as I am faced with that warm, carefree smile.@
` It's kind of embarrassing.\

`"Is a western-style breakfast like yesterday fine with you, Shiki-san?"@
`"---Ah… yeah.@ I really don't mind… So, breakfast, huh?@ That bath felt so good that I almost forgot about it."@
`"Really?@ You didn't eat last night either, so I was talking to Hisui-chan about how maybe the sound of your stomach might have woken you up."@
`"Ahaha, no.@ Sadly, that's not the case.@ I've been a light eater since I was little, so I often skip one or two meals at a time."\
`"I see.@ Now that you mention it, you've got a nice body without any excess meat on you.@ Could it be that you're a vegetarian?"@
`"Hmm, perhaps.@ Come to think of it, I get the feeling that all I ate at the Arima house were vegetables."@
` Kohaku-san busily heads back to the sitting room.@
` ---But I don't feel like eating right now.\
`"Ah, it's alright, Kohaku-san.@ I'll go to school without eating today.@ Tell Akiha for me."@
br
`"Bye." I head towards the doorway.@
` Suddenly, my arm is tightly grabbed.@

`"---Eh?"@
` …… I can't believe it.@
` Kohaku-san is angry.\
`"What are you saying, Shiki-san!?@ Haven't you looked in the mirror this morning!?"@
`"…… Ah, well, I took a look in the bathroom mirror…"@
`"You're lying!@ You wouldn't say something like that if you looked even once!"@
` Kohaku-san is seriously angry.@
` …… Come to think of it, when I saw my face in the mirror, I think I saw death warmed over.\
`"I'll be fine.@ It's just that I don't have a lot of blood in me, so I look worse than normal people."@
`"This won't do!@ You won't grow without eating breakfast!@ If you don't have an appetite, I'll prepare you something easy to eat.@ So please, go to the dining room."@
` Holding on to my arm, she drags me towards the sitting room.@

`"Good morning, Nii-san.@ How do you feel?"@
` Akiha greets me reservedly.@
` That firmness about her yesterday is gone.@ I guess it's because she's worried about me.@

`"…… Hey, listen, there's no need for that.@ I'm not like a primary school kid, I can make it home by myself no matter how bad I feel."\
`"Then I guess the fact you could not make it home last night would mean you are a child."@
`"---Mmn."@
br
` It sucks to admit it, but Akiha is right.@
br
`"…… Yesterday was different.@ That kind of thing is really rare.@ Look, just because I have chronic anemia doesn't make my body weak.@ There's no reason for you to worry about every little thing, Akiha.@ Yesterday was… you know… just a terminal case of bad timing.@ That's all."@
