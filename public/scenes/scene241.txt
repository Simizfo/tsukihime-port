` I know that looking for Yumizuka is dangerous.@
` No matter what her reason is, she did kill that many people.@

` That way home in the sunset.@
` I cannot forget the last words she said.\

`"…… I'll go.@ Obsessing over it won't do any good."@
` I change clothes, and slip my knife into my pocket.@
` I tiptoe out the mansion, so as not to wake Akiha or the others.@

`"Nii-san?@ You're going out, at this hour?"@

`"Akiha--so, you got back, huh?"@
`"Yes, just a little while ago.@

` But anyway--what are you doing, Nii-san?@ You've changed your clothes, so it appears you are going out."@
` Akiha gazes intently at me.\
` It's not a look of blame.@
` She is merely gazing at me uneasily.\

`"You're going to go out and get hurt again, like last night.@ Aren't you, Nii-san?"@
`"…… I'm sorry.@ A friend of mine is in trouble.@ I can't let it go."@

`"Yeah, but I won't do anything dangerous.@ I'm just going to check it out a bit.@ …… I'm sorry to cause trouble like this, when I've only just come home."@
` Saying so, I begin walking out.\

`"Ah--"@
` A soft voice comes from behind me.@
`"Nii… san."@
` A weak voice, so unlike Akiha's usual tone.@
` …… It's just like her voice from eight years ago--tinged with unease.\

`"Akiha…?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t17b.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

`"You'll… come back, won't you?"@
`"----"@
` Akiha's weak, vulnerable face.@
` It has none of its earlier coldness, but like Akiha's childhood face, it's close to tears.\

`"…… What are you talking about?@ I'm only going out for a moment.@ You shouldn't make a face like that."@
`"I… I know, but…"@
`"It's okay.@ I'll come right back.@ I'm sorry, Akiha; I've always been causing you trouble."@
`"Ah--Nii-san!"@

` Ignoring Akiha's voice behind me, I leave the mansion.\

` …… Outside, a moonlit night.@
` Perhaps because I saw Akiha's unsettled expression.@
` For some reason, I feel I may never return here.\
