`"Wait~~~~~~!"@
` Whoosh!@ I get up forcefully from bed.@
br
` *pant*----*pant*----*pant*@
br
` My breathing is out of control and my mind is still numbed with the feel of Arcueid.@
` …… No, hold on Shiki.@ Try to be calm, it can't hurt.\

` ----First, this is my room.@
` Check.@ That's good.@
br
` ----Second, I'm on my bed.@
` Check.@ Seems that way.@
br
` ----And, it's now morning, and I was having sex with Arcueid until now.@
` Check.@ That's good----that's not good!@ Never, not even slightly, not one bit………!\

` The sound of my panting fills the air.@
` I manage to catch my breath.@
` My hands gripping the sheets are drenched in sweat.@ There is a lingering warmth as if I really was sleeping with Arcueid until just now.@
br
` …… But it definitely was a dream.@
` I can't tell if that's something I should be happy or disappointed about.\

`"----Why----"@
` did I see such a dream?@
` Does that mean I'm so interested in her that I see her in my dreams?@
` Does that mean--I want her so bad I do those things with her in my dream?\

`"------Uu"@
` As I remember, the sensation of her skin forces itself into my brain.@
` I feel my arms to make sure this is real.@
` …… Yeah, it's real.@
` Her skin was so fundamentally different from a guy's skin… so soft, so warm.\

`"Yeah…… So hot I wanted to go wild."@
` Just thinking about it makes my breath go wild.@
` …… Well.@ Whatever happened, it's true that it felt exceedingly good.@
` I should feel a bit guilty dreaming about doing that to Arcueid, but I recall the dream and just sit there thinking about it.\

`"Shiki-sama."@
`"Uwaaaaaa!"@
quakey 2,100

` I flail around off my bed as if trying to escape.@
` No--in fact I was trying to escape, but it just ended up with me landing on the floor with the sheets.\

`"Hi, Hihi, Hisui…… !?@ H, how long have you been there!?"@
`"Since before you awoke, Shiki-sama."@
` She speaks with her usual lack of expression.@
` Still lying on the floor tangled in the sheets and unable to stand, I look up at Hisui's face.\

`"…… Before I… woke up……"@
br
` --Then, that means…
br
` Hisui saw my face when I was having that dream?@
` My face turns deep red.@
` Hisui just stands there, expressionless as usual, and makes no attempt to speak.\

`"Um…… did I look… strange……?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I do not wish to describe it."@
`"Ah--h"@
` …… I knew it.@ I must have looked really weird.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"But, if you insist, Shiki-sama, I can describe as accurately as I can."@
`"…… No, you don't have to do that……"@
` My face still flushed, I speak in a fading voice.@
`"Um, Hisui-san?"@
` I give a cough to clear the silence.@
` …… Adding "san" to her name is a clear sign of my vulnerability.\


`"What is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Um…… I'm going to change, so would you mind waiting outside?"@
br
` --Or rather, I'm so embarrassed I just want her to leave.@
` But Hisui doesn't obey today of all days.\

`"Once I can confirm you are awake, I will leave the room, Shiki-sama."@
`"……!"@
` Huh?@ Is, is is is she joking!?@
` Why does she think I'm covering myself up in these sheets!?@
` It's to hide something that's still standing!\

`"I, I'm fine, so please leave.@ I can get up, and I won't go back to sleep.@ I'll change and go to the sitting room as soon as you leave."@
`"Shiki-sama--Are you hurt and unable to stand……?"@

cl c,%type_crossfade_mid

` Hisui approaches me out of worry.\

`"No, that's not it.@ I'm standing----I mean I can stand, so don't worry about it."@
` I crawl pulling my sheets like a slug, and gain some distance from her.@
` Using the bed as a barrier, I get far enough away.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Then, please excuse me.@ I will prepare your breakfast, so please come after you change."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` She has got to be suspicious, but she bows and leaves the room.\

` *sigh*@
` I was so surprised.@
` The contents of my dream were surprising enough, but knowing Hisui saw me while I was dreaming is very troubling.@
` …… It's all Arcueid's fault for doing something like that.@
`"Even now she's being bothersome, really----"\

` Really----really what?@
` I can't finish.@
`"………………?"@
` What did I want to say just now?@
` Not even able to confirm my own feelings, I decide to change and head to the sitting room with a vague feeling in my chest.\

` After calming down sufficiently, I head to the sitting room.@
` As usual, Akiha is sitting on the sofa, elegantly sipping tea.@
br

`"Good morning, Nii-san.@ You are certainly up early this morning."@
` She must be happy I woke up because she greets me with a smile.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah, good morning.@ There were, well, a lot of things going on this morning."@
` As soon as I say that--I suddenly recall the memory of Arcueid's skin.\

`"Uh--"@
` This isn't good.@ I can tell my face is blushing beyond my control.@
`"Nii-san--?"@
` A brief clamor.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What's wrong?@ Your face is red, do you have a fever?"@
`"-----!"@
` Rushing over to me, she looks up at me from below.@
` But--In doing so, from this angle, um----\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` Akiha sighs.@
`"You do seem to have a fever.@ Kohaku, come quickly.@ Nii-san doesn't seem to be well."@
` Akiha calls out to the dining room.@
` Kohaku-san has to be preparing my breakfast in the kitchen.\

`"I'm fine--!@ It's just a minor cold, so don't worry!"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"If it is a cold, then I can't let it go by.@ For you, a trivial illness is a big deal.@ The strength of your immune system is much lower than most people's."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

\

` Akiha seems to be fed up and puts her hand on my forehead.@
br
` The sensation of her cool, delicate hand--
br
`"!!!!!!!!"@
` This isn't good.@
` This isn't good at all, so I break loose and run out to the lobby.\

`"Shiki-sama?@ Have you finished your breakfast already?"@
`"No, that's not it, but--Um, where's my bag?"@
`"I have your bag here.@ Are you already going to school?"@
` Nodding, I snatch my bag from Hisui.@
`"I'm going.@ Don't worry about seeing me off!"\

`"Nii-san, you've been acting strange.@ What are you doing with a fever like that?"@
`"Geez, I told you it's nothing!@ Since it's nothing, I'm going to school!@ I'll have breakfast later, so leave me alone!"@
`"Leave you alone--hey, Nii-san!?"@
br
` The sound of my fleeing footsteps is my only response.\

bg "image\bg\bg_32a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

`"Sigh----"@
` Even if it is Akiha, she wouldn't chase me this far.\
` Since we're not kids anymore, she won't stop me from going to school.\

`"----Whew."@
`  I take a deep breath and am finally able to calm down.@
`"……… What am I running away for?"@
` Once I calm down, I can think clearly.@
` I didn't do anything wrong, so there was no need for me to run away like that.\

`"--I don't believe it.@ I look like a complete idiot."@
` But, to go back to the mansion to eat breakfast sounds more dumb.@
`"--To school, then?"@
` Letting out a sigh, I go downhill along the residential street.\
