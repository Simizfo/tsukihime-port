` In the sitting room, Akiha is on the sofa, Kohaku-san is keeping her company, and Hisui is standing by the wall.@

`"Good morning, Shiki-san."@
`"Morning, Kohaku-san.@ Sorry to be a bother, but could you fix me something to eat?@ I'm a little hungry from all that sleeping."@

`"Yes, right away.@ I will get it ready, so please wait a little bit."@

` Kohaku-san quickly patters away towards the dining room.\

` That leaves Akiha and Hisui, who is standing wordlessly like a statue.@
`"…… Yo, Akiha.@ G'morning."@

`"……………………"@
` Akiha just looks at me with a dissatisfied look on her face and doesn't return my greeting.@
`"…………… Uh."@
` Like Hisui warned me, she seems angry about last night.@
` Telling me in the morning that leaving late at night is forbidden only to find me leaving late at night.@ It's only natural for her to be angry.\

`"Akiha.@ Last night, was---"@

`"Nii-san.@ Sleeping in this late… just what were you thinking?"@
`"Eh---um, well, I… Sorry."@

`"…… Geez, I'm not mad about that.@ It's your day off, and you've chosen to sleep in until now.@ It's your laziness that angers me!"@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` With a "hmph", Akiha angrily turns her face away.@
` …… Well, it may just be my imagination, but "peevishly" is a better word than "angrily".\

`"Well, I couldn't help it.@ I got in late last night, and my body was just tired."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t06b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"That is entirely your fault.@ Staying out until way past midnight… Just what kind of lifestyle did you have when you lived with the Arimas, Nii-san!?"@
`"Uh…… I had a strict curfew there, too.@ I wasn't allowed to leave at night, and……"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, so that's it.@ At the Arimas' house, you followed the rules, but you come here and break them?@
` …… In other words, you won't even follow my simplest request?@ In that case, I may have to resort to corporal punishment."@
` The fury of her intent also flows through her eyes.@
` …… How do I say this?@ She has to be joking, only she doesn't sound like she's kidding, and it's pretty frightening.\

`"…… Corporal punishment, Akiha?@ You're starting to frighten me."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That was just an example.@ Staying up real late like that and just sleeping until you feel like getting up?@ Of course I should be very strict."@
` Akiha gives an audible groan.@
` …… I hate to admit it, but she is right.\

` "Besides, Nii-san.@ Shouldn't you let Hisui wake you up in the morning?@
` It is a good thing today is Sunday, but you always, always laze around in bed too long, Nii-san."@
`"…… Um, Akiha.@ Maybe it's not my place to say, but it's not like I'm sleeping in because I want to."@

`"Ah----"@
`"………?"@
` Where did the dire, threatening atmosphere go?@ All of a sudden, Akiha descends into silence.\

`"Hey, Akiha.@ I said so before, but waking up past seven o'clock in the morning isn't intentional.@
` Even I would like to get up earlier, but my body doesn't listen to what I tell it.@
` If you want to help me wake up earlier, please buy me a really powerful alarm clock.@ I'm sure that'd get me up."@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Uh, Nii-san?@ This may be a stupid question, but did you ever tell Hisui what time you wanted her to wake you up?"@
`"----Ah."@
` That's right, I forgot such a simple thing as that.\

`"Oh yeah.@ Hisui comes every morning to wake me, so it's alright for her to do that.@
` So… Hisui, could you please wake me up at six-thirty each morning?@ It would really help me out……"@
` I swing around to face Hisui.@
` She stares right back at me.\

`"Eh?"@

`"Forgive me, but I refuse to wake you up, Shiki-sama."@
`"Well, um--"@
` I don't know what to say.@ The shock put my brain on hold.@


` Looking at the situation, Akiha is also gaping at Hisui in surprise.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hisui, why can't you wake up Nii-san?"@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t17.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I am unable to undertake things I cannot do.@
` I do not think I am able to wake up Shiki-sama with my own power."@
`"----Unable?@ Why not?"@
` I unthinkingly enter their conversation.@
` Hisui continues staring at me.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"These past three days, all my efforts were fruitless.@
` Shiki-sama, do you remember how many times I called your name this morning?"\

`"No, I don't remember----I woke up from your voice?@ I thought I woke up by myself……"@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That means there is no memory of me even calling out.@----Akiha-sama, that is the situation."@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, I see," Akiha says and looks over at me teasingly.@
` …… How do I say this…… it would seem my standing here has just been lowered quite a bit.\

`"In short, you have tried repeatedly to wake up Nii-san, but there isn't even the slightest reaction on his part---that's how it is, Hisui?"@
` Hisui nods silently.@
`"………………"@
` I nod silently as well.@
` …… I see.@ The truth is, Hisui has already been trying to wake me up early in the morning.@
` I don't want to say it myself, but I must be really good at sleeping in.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t02b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"……… Nii-san.@ Why are you looking so proud of yourself?"@
`"Nothing.@ I was just surprised by how daunting it is to wake me."@
`"…… Hmm.@ I understand.@ Hisui, just like before, please try and wake up Nii-san as much as you can."@
` Hisui nods in assent.@
br
` It seems like the conversation is finished.@
` In the end, it may be just me waking up whenever I feel like it again.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey, by the way, Hisui?"@
`"Yes, what is it?"@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Um.@ Does Nii-san really not wake up?@ Even if you call his name, he doesn't respond?"@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---Yes.@ Shiki-sama's sleep is very quiet, and he sleeps like a statue."@
`"……………?"@
` …… Like a statue?@ What?\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\aki_t08b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh?@ Nii-san has a great sleeping posture, huh?"@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, that is not it---how do I say it… um, Shiki-sama is like a completely different person when he sleeps.@
` I have never seen such a peaceful sleeping face, so when I first saw him, I thought that he had passed away, I---"\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t20.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"So it is not quite that he is hard to awaken, but that it seems very rude to do so, so I can not help but be very gentle.@
` Once Shiki-sama is about to wake up by himself, warmth returns to his white face, and I know he will wake up soon, but---"@

` Looking down, Hisui talks about how I look when I sleep.\

`"……………"@
` …… I can't help but feel embarrassed.@
` Come to think of it, a sleeping person is completely defenseless, and after listening to that explanation, I flush as red as if she said she saw me naked.@
` Hisui descends into silence, and Akiha is obviously trying not to look in my direction.@

`"Yes, please take your time eating."@

` After I eat lunch, Akiha and Hisui are still in the sitting room.@
` It wouldn't be good to ignore them and go back to my room, so I sit on the sofa across from Akiha.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

` "Here, Shiki-san.@ You prefer green tea, right?"@
` Kohaku-san places an after meal cup of tea on the table beside me.@
`"Yeah, thanks.@ If you don't mind, then."@
`"No, not at all.@ This is your home, so please relax a little more."@
` Kohaku-san must be trying to make me feel more comfortable here because she takes good care of me.\

`"…… Geez.@ I'm thinking I'm already used to this place.@ Do I still look a little strained?"@
`"Yes, just a little bit.@ Your shoulders seem a little tense.@ I wouldn't say you should be like back then, but you certainly can relax a bit more."\

`"Kohaku, you shouldn't spoil Nii-san.@
` He's been living like a sloth at the Arimas' house so long, it's probably good for him to be a little tense just at first."\

`"Heehee.@ Akiha-sama, you are really strict with Shiki-san, are you not?"@

`"I don't want to be strict.@ It's just that he is always so spaced out, I have to watch out for him."\

cl a,%type_lshutter_fst

` "……… Huh?"@
` I'm a little surprised.@
` When Akiha talks to Kohaku-san, there isn't any hint of her usual coldness.@
` Maybe it's because they're so close in age, but they seem to be really good friends.\

`"………"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

` I glance over at Hisui.@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Since Akiha dismissed all of the other servants except for Hisui and Kohaku-san, I think Hisui must be trusted by Akiha as well.@
` But, since Kohaku-san is her complete opposite in personality, I have a feeling that there isn't much talk between Hisui and Akiha.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"May I be of service, Shiki-sama?"@
` Hisui realizes I was looking at her and asks me if there is anything she can do.@
`"No, it's nothing.@ I was just thinking that you're really calm."@
`"---Yes.@ It is something that Makihisa-sama taught to me."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` She answers very distinctly.@
` …… The answer is so distinct, I can't continue the conversation.@
`"………………"@
` An uncomfortable silence ensues.\
` As if sensing this, Kohaku-san starts up a conversation.\

`"Shiki-san.@ Is it okay if I ask a question?"@
`"Eh---ah, yeah.@ What is it?"@
`"It seems like you left last night again, so I was wondering if you had some usual, scheduled routine to take care of every night."@
`"Ah---no, I don't have anything like that.@ The past two days were just something special."@
` I look over at Hisui.@

` She just quietly watches the two of us.\

cl r,%type_lshutter_fst

`"It's alright, Kohaku-san.@ I won't go out late at night anymore.@ Besides, I'm not a kid anymore, so it's not like there's any danger or anything."@

`"See, even Hisui-chan is angry.@ You are anemic, so you shouldn't strain yourself, you know?@
` I was told this by your personal physician too, Shiki-san."@
`"…… Well, that's true, but it has nothing to do with going out late at night.@ If I can't walk by myself, I shouldn't go to school either, right?"@

`"It does have something to do with it.@ During the day it is bright outside and someone could help you, right?@ But at night it's different.@ There's been all these vampire murders recently, so if you go outside and collapse, what do you think will happen?"@
`"Ah…………"\

` Without thinking, my body shudders.@
` Just hearing someone else use the word "vampire" like this really reminds me that it was Yumizuka killing those people.\
