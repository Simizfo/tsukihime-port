` Bonjour!@
` The hint corner for Tohno-kun, who has ended up in this Dead End with only a bit left to go,
` It is time for "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!"\

` The fifth period is about battles with vampires.@
` I have brought Professor Roa as a special guest.@
` Professor Roa, what is the reason for Tohno-kun's loss this time?@

`"I have to say he was a bit careless.@
` Finding out about your enemy's weapon is the top priority in a battle against the transcendent race.@
` Well, in this case, I think that he knew about it but, didn't act very intelligently."\

` I see.@
` Excuse me, Professor, but why does SHIKI-san in this route look different than you?@
` I've been wondering about this for a long time.@

`"Yes, I think it's just a difference in tastes.@
` When SHIKI's mind was weak, Roa's preferences surfaced and I dressed like this.@
` But in this case, SHIKI-kun completely lost his mind for some reason, and Roa could not come out since he relies on taking control of someone's mind.@ That is my theory on what happened."\

` Oh really?@ So in Akiha-san's route, SHIKI-san is the real Tohno SHIKI.@
` …… They say Tohno-kun is like SHIKI-kun, but they're not alike at all……\
