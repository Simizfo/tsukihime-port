` I glance at the clock.@
` It's already past nine.@
` I'd be late even if I went to school now---and to be honest, going with Arcueid is more fun than going to school……\

`"Alright.@ I'll spend the day with you.@ But if we go into the city during the day, I don't think there'll be any Dead around?"@

`"I don't care about that.@ I just wanted to walk around, so even if it is daytime, it doesn't matter."@
`"……?@ What, aren't we making up for last night and going to look for vampires?"\

`"Yes, of course we'll look tonight.@ But to have you help me all day and night would be hard, so during the day I thought we could relax."@
`"I think that'd be more fun too.@ But, just the two of us walking around, that's……"\

` like what they call a date in the real world.@
` …… Maybe you can't say that with a vampire like Arcueid, but I suppose she's telling me to take her out for some fun.@
` For me, I----I need to get ready mentally and…\

`"……?@ What's wrong, Shiki?@ Your face, it's turning red."@
`"------Uh."@
` I cover my face with my hands and look away.@

` …… Certainly it's been just the two of us many times before.@
` But, those were emergency situations, and it was more like a pact of cooperation than anything between a man and a woman.@
` That's why----no matter how pretty I thought she was, I tried not to notice it.\

` But, if…
` Without any danger, without any purpose, if the two of us just walk around, I might notice something I never noticed before, and it makes me hesitate----\

`"…… No way.@ I said I'd do it, so I will.@ I don't know what you're thinking, but walking around shouldn't be a problem."@

`"Wait a minute.@ I'm going to change, so can you just look outside for a while?"@

`"What, did you call me?"@
`"Oh, yes, no!@ Just go outside, I'll be there soon."@

` She jumps out the window with the lightness of a cat.@
` I hear the rustling of the trees outside.@
` She didn't jump to the ground, but along the tree branches.@

` …… With a body like that, it should have been easy getting in here undetected.\

`"…… This isn't the time to be impressed.@ I too have to sneak out without Hisui noticing."@
` I change into some normal clothes.@
` Cracking open the door slightly, I look around to make sure no one's in the hallway and tip-toe outside.\

` Luckily, no one saw me as I made my way out.@
` Arcueid is looking the other way as she mumbles to herself.@

`"Eh?@ Ah, yeah, we should go."@
` Completely different from before, her words seem very empty.\

`"What is it?@ This isn't like you at all.@ Did something happen again just now?"@
`"…… No, nothing really."@
` I said the 'again' part strong, but her words are still hollow.@
br
` ----It seems like she's planning something.@ I feel kind of scared.@

` "Yes," Arcueid nods meekly.\

`"I dashed here with all my strength and snuck into your room…… but it seems strange when I think about it now.@
` Why was I so angry back then?@ It was just a little promise."@
` Saying she doesn't get it, Arcueid crosses her arms in thought.\

`"Ah, that's right.@ Maybe you get it, Shiki?@ You always tell me I'm so stupid, so maybe you can understand?"@
`"Hey……"@
` If she doesn't understand herself, then how does she expect me to?@
` There's no way I understand, but if I have to respond----
