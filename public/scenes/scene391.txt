` ---After dinner, I return to my room.@
br
` It's ten at night.@
` Since I had tea with Akiha and the others after dinner, it's already time for bed.\

`"Nnn……"@
` I'm not really tired, but my body feels sluggish.@
` It seems like I've finally gotten used to life in this mansion.@
` Expressionless Hisui, bright and cheery Kohaku, and Akiha, who worries over me constantly.@
` …… Certainly, getting used to this lifestyle… is fun.@ It seems like I've returned to the me that existed eight years ago.\

` I never had a chance to relax this much when living with the Arimas.@
` The Arimas have a child in middle school as well, but we were always distant and we never really had a chance to talk.@
`"Nnn…… I really am sleepy."@
` Changing into my pajamas, I lie down in bed.@

` I'll go to bed early, wake up early, and give Akiha quite a surprise---\

`"----Huh?"@
` All of a sudden, I find myself in town.\

br
br
` Midnight.@
` I walk through the empty town.\

` I pant heavily.@
br
` For some reason, I'm out of breath.@
` I.@
` With bloodshot eyes, I am looking at people walking down the street.\

br
` Foolish people.@
` Walking the streets so carelessly even though the killer has not been caught.@
br
` ----Do they think that they're special and won't get killed?@ Or maybe, they want to die but are unable to kill themselves and want someone to kill them?@
br
` Well, it's probably the latter.\

br
` ---A group of people that I don't know continues to walk by.\

` That's not the person.@
` That's not the person.@
` That's not the person.@
br
` I diligently stare at them one by one, but shake my head.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` That's not the person.@
` That's not the person.@
` That's not the person.@
br
` I still can't find that person.\
` I definitely heard what this person looks like, but I can't seem to find that person.\

#ff0000
`   I'm   getting  a little   annoyed.@
#ffffff
br
`                      Not here.\
`     Not here.@
`                 Not here.@
` Not here.@
`         Why.@
`    Not here.@
`            Not here.@
`                       Not here.@
`   Not here.\

` I start panting even more.@
br
` It's really ticking me off.@
` Why isn't that person here,

`"Ku-----haha, ha."@
br
` I've decided.@
` Tonight, I'll change my plan.@
` Anyone will do.@
` If I can kill, anyone will do.@
` Once more.@
` Once more, I want to taste that wonderful sensation----\

br
` ---There.@
br
` A girl with long hair walks by.\

`"Aki, ha!"@
` Yeah, that is Akiha.@
` Akiha.@ Akiha.@ My sister.@ My beautiful sister, only mine.@
br
#ff0000
`       That is what I want.@
#ffffff
br
` My sister, only mine.@
` She is definitely mine, and mine only.\

` I kill her from behind, taking care not to damage her body.@
` Holding her long hair, I drag her body.\

bg "image\bg\bg_31b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


` Heavy breathing.@
br
` Biting into her neck, I suck her blood.@
br
` -----My breath becomes wild.@
br
` This murder is different than the others.@
` Akiha.@ Just thinking this is Akiha makes it feel so wonderful.@
` My brain becomes numb.@
` I get fully aroused.\

br
br
br
br
br
` As I suck her blood,
` sucking every last drop of blood, I ejaculate over and over.\

`"H------huh?"@
` When it's all over, I realize it.@
`"…… Who is this person?@ This isn't Akiha at all……!"@
` I'm angry.\
` Even though I slice the body into pieces, I'm still mad.@
` Impostor.@
` This impostor is pissing me off.\

` *pant*----*pant*----*pant*----
` I've used up extra energy.@
` The night isn't that long.@
` Once it becomes morning, Shiki will awaken.@
br
`"I'm tired tonight.@ I'll start again, tomorrow."@
` Yeah, that'll do.@ That's what I'll do.@
br
` Now then.@
` Before the morning comes, before anyone realizes, I must go back to my own bed----\
