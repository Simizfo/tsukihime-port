` It's after dinner, and we drink tea in the sitting room.@
` Akiha sits across from me and Hisui stands by the wall.@
` There is no such thing as a TV in the room, and Akiha doesn't say much.@
br
` ---Everything seems so… high-class.\

`"Shiki-saaan, can you come here for a moment?"@
` Kohaku-san's cheerful voice calls from the lobby.@

`"Nii-san?@ Kohaku is calling you.@ Did you do anything to make her call for you?"@
`"No, I don't remember anything---I'll be right back."\

` I leave Akiha and Hisui behind and go to the lobby.@
` Kohaku-san is pacing back and forth by the entrance.@
`"…… Kohaku-san.@ What are you doing?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Ah, Shiki-san.@ Well, it's a little complicated…… Can you please step outside with me?@ Here is not a good place."@
`"……?"@
` I don't understand what's going on, but I follow her anyway.\

`"You have something to tell me?@ Is it a secret or something?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ If Akiha-sama were to hear it, she would get mad at you, Shiki-san."@
` Something Akiha would get mad over……?@
`"What do you mean?@ I haven't done anything to make her mad."@
`"Oh, it isn't anything you did.@ But you know, while you were eating with Akiha-sama, a guest came to see you."\

`"Huh?@ A guest, for me?"@
`"Yes.@ She was walking around the front gate, so I called out to her.@ She was wearing the school uniform of your high school."@
` And then Kohaku-san began to describe the guest's appearance.@
` About my age, with a slightly childish face.@ A cute girl, her long hair tied in pigtails……?\

`"…………"@
` Thump.@ I feel as if my world is enveloped in darkness.@
` That description.@
` Isn't it Yumizuka Satsuki, who ran away from home---\

`"She asked 'Is this Tohno-san's mansion?' And I answered 'Yes it is.' Then she asked 'Is Tohno-kun here now?'"@
`"…… Hmm.@ And then what, Kohaku-san?"@
`"Yes, well she seemed to want to talk to you, but she refused when I asked if she wanted to come in.@ She seemed okay that she would not get to meet you right now."@
` Kohaku-san wonders aloud what it was all about, and she tilts her head.@
` But, I'm the one who wants to know.\

`"Why------why did Yumizuka-san come to my place……"@
` I don't know.@
` I don't know, but, I have a bad feeling about this.@
`"…… Kohaku-san, how long ago was this?"@
`"Um, it was before the end of dinner, so about ten minutes ago."@
`"--!@ And, which direction did she go?"@
`"She went down the hill, towards the station, I think."\

` ---Can I make it?@
` If I run---if I get lucky, I might make it.@
`"…… Got it.@ I'll be gone for a little bit, so please keep this a secret from Akiha."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I understand.@ If Akiha-sama found out, she would not leave you alone, Shiki-san."@
` Giving a quick bow to the smiling and cheerful Kohaku-san, I run down the road and into the night.\

` *pant*…… *pant*, *pant*………
` I'm out of breath.@
` My legs are painfully aware of how fast I was running, and they stop.\

`"…… I, knew…… it wouldn't, be this easy, to find, her……"@

` Trying to control my breathing, I start to run again.\

` ---I don't see Yumizuka Satsuki anywhere.@
br
` It's only natural, but I can't seem to give up that easily.@
` …… I don't think it is because I am so worried about her.@
` It's just that I have this terrible premonition, that's why I am running like this.\


` ---I'll be going.@ Bye-bye, Tohno-kun.@
br
` That was a goodbye just like any other.@
` …… A truly happy, gentle smile.@
` That was not the face of someone who'd run away from home.@
br
` ---Tohno-kun, help me when I'm in a pinch, okay?@
br
` Yes, it really is that simple.@
` I just… don't want to betray that smile----\

` I pant with exertion.@
` I don't see her in the park, either.@
` …… There wasn't a way to find her from the beginning.@
` I should just give up and go back to the mansion.@
`"…… Damn…… it……"@
` Still, I try to look for her as I turn to go back through town.\

` I come to the front of the station once more.@
` It's already past nine o'clock.@
` It's probably because of all the recent serial killings that the area around the station is quite empty already.@
br
` ----At that moment,
br
`"Yumi----zuka."@
` For an instant, I doubt my eyes.@
` But the back of the figure in front of me, it resembles Yumizuka Satsuki too much.\

` Yumizuka walks quickly into the midst of the crowd.@
` …… I can't tell for sure.@
` I may have been wrong, but I decided I should catch up to her and call out to her.@
`"Wait, Yumizuka-san---!"@

` That face… there's no confusing it.@

`"----Ah."@

` ---Thump.@

` The back of my head throbs heavily, and my throat is burning.@

` I feel dizzy as if I'm in the grip of a terrible fever.@

` In that moment, Yumizuka begins to walk again.\

`"Wa---wait, Yumizuka-san…!"@

` I urge my hot body onwards.@
` But, no matter how much I try, I cannot catch Yumizuka.@

` …… No matter how fast I run, I cannot catch up to her even as she walks.\

`"------"@
` Something is… strange.@

` Right now, all I can do is follow Yumizuka Satsuki.@

` I lose sight of her.@
` Yumizuka Satsuki, whom I had been chasing without success, is nowhere to be seen.\

`"…… Shit… What the hell is going on…!"@
` I stop, catching my breath.@
` My chest heaves deeply.@
` …… Though I hadn't realized until now, I must have been running for a long time.@
`"What… time is it…?"@
` Resting my hands on my knees, I glance up at a nearby store window.@
` It is--already midnight.\

`"----Can't be.@ I couldn't have been running for that long."@
` …… It's hard to believe, but the clock is correct.@
` Looking around, most all the lights in the shopping district are off.\

`"---I should… go back."@
` Even though I'm worried about Yumizuka, I feel like I won't be able to find her anymore.@
` …… I chased her for almost three hours, calling her name all this time, but she did not even respond.@ What was she thinking?@
br
` With a big sigh, I decide to head back to the mansion.\
