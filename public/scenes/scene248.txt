br
` I pull out my secret weapon.\

`"Tohno-kun, do you think I can just be bought with food!?"@
` Senpai shouts from the other side.@
` …… Maybe this less than one hundred yen bread didn't work.@
`"……………"@
` Geez.@ I think trying to barge in would make her more angry, so I guess I should just go back.@

` ---And then,\

`"Se, Senpai--?"@

`"Come to think of it, I shouldn't be taking this out on you Tohno-kun.@ Turning away a guest that came here would be a little rude."@
` With a red face, she mumbles something like an excuse.\

`"Senpai, does that mean, we can eat lunch together?"@

` Senpai goes into the tea ceremony room.@
` Following behind her, I walk inside.\

` I start to eat with Senpai.@
` Even though I got the impression that she was in a bad mood from Arihiko and her reaction back then, it certainly doesn't seem that way.\

`"…… Senpai.@ I heard this from Arihiko, but you're angry at me?@ How come?"@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Eh--no, I'm not really angry at you.@ It's more of an indirect thing…… Maybe, it's more your insensitivity?"@
`"…… Wait a sec Senpai.@ You're normally a hard person to understand, but today you're even more so.@ If you're angry at my insensitivity, that's fine, but what do you mean by 'maybe'?@
` Senpai, you don't understand how you feel?"\



ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


` She sighs.@
` "I'm a little unsure.@ I'm not usually concerned with myself."@
` Senpai almost sounds apologetic.@
`"---Probably, I don't like myself."@
`"…… Senpai?"@
` Senpai sits in silence without looking at me.@
` After a short moment of silence, she suddenly glares at me.\

`"More importantly, Tohno-kun."@
`"…… Yes?"@
` Straightening up, I look back into her eyes.@
` …… Since I know she's about to begin a very serious conversation.@
br
`"Uh…… what is it, Senpai?"\

`"Could I have that curry bread?"@

br
`"Wh, what's with that all of a sudden!?@ Didn't you just say you won't be bought out by food!?"@




ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t10a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"That's a different matter.@ Tohno-kun, are you trying to take back what you said earlier!?"@
br
` …… Senpai is really angry.@
` It was just a joke for me, but I guess she took it very seriously.\

`"…… Yes, yes, I understand.@ Please accept this, Your Highness."@
` I hand over the curry bread.@
` Giving that up, I only have some sausage bread left.@

br
` "Yay!" Senpai happily takes it from me.@
` …… Is she a kid or something?\

`"Then I will give you some of this hamburger.@
` Here you go," Senpai says as she gives me half of it from her lunch.@
`"………"@
` I think the difference in the barter exchange rate was a little high…\

` After we finish our meals, we pass the time while sipping tea.@
` A perfectly tranquil passing of time.@
br
` It seems like she's not conscious of my presence, and I'm not especially conscious of her presence either.@
br
` Just, a calmness.@
` Like two friends of the same gender, we pass the remaining break time like this.\



`"Hey, Tohno-kun."@
`"Yes?@ What is it, Senpai?"@


`"I've been thinking about this for a while, but your glasses aren't used to correct your vision, right?"@
`"…… Wow, you're amazing Senpai, bullseye.@ They're just for show."@
br
`"I knew it," Senpai nods.\



`"Hey, Tohno-kun, could I ask a favor?"@
` Senpai looks expectantly at my eyes.@ …… Not so much my eyes, but my glasses.@
`"Just once, could you take off those glasses?"@
`"---------"@
` That would be troubling.@
` Taking these glasses off means I would see those "lines" and more importantly---I don't want to see the "death" of this person close to me.\

`"I can't do that.@ Unfortunately, I've never taken these off in front of others.@ It's kind of like a vow, so I'll reject your request."@
` I answer clearly.@
` Senpai slumps disappointedly.@





`"Huh, if you say so, then I guess it's not possible."@
`"Yes, because these past eight years, I never---"@
br
` …… never took them off in front of other people, but.@

`"----"@
` That's right.@ That ended.@
` With these eyes.@
` I saw the death of many, many things.\
