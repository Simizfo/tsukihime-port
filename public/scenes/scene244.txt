` At lunch break, that guy who didn't even show up for a single class arrives.@

`"Yo Tohno!@ Food, let's get some food!"@
` He's happy about something, being even more energetic than usual.\

`"Of course, food.@ But you seem to be in a great mood.@ Did something happen, Arihiko?"@
`"Yup.@ I just asked Senpai if she wanted to eat lunch together, and she refused."@
`"………………"@
` That's odd.@
` "Senpai" must be referring to Ciel-senpai, but this guy seems to get happy when his offer is refused.\

`"Hey, Arihiko, you have that sort of taste?"@

`"No, no, I'm not finished.@ So I asked Senpai why not, and she said 'If Tohno-kun is there, then I don't want to come'!!@ Uwahahahahahahahaha!@ Isn't that great, Tohno!?"@
`"……………"@
` That's odd.@
` Why have I been friends with this guy since middle school?\

`"Oh man, she really hates you Tohno!@ A rival's loss is my gain, so I'll treat you to lunch today!"@
` Arihiko happily slaps my back.@
`"…… Well, I'm happy you're treating me, but Senpai was angry at me?"@

`"N?@ …… well, after she asked 'will Tohno-kun be with us?' and I nodded, her face turned all red.@ As soon as she heard your name, her face probably burned with anger."@
`"…… Probably?@ Isn't that a little different, Arihiko?"@
`"Maybe.@ Maybe not."@

` …… Arihiko's story can't be trusted.@
` Certainly Senpai did seem angry this morning, but I don't know why she would be.@
`"…… No way, she couldn't have realized what kind of dream I had."@
` If she could figure that out from that one conversation, she'd make a great detective.\
