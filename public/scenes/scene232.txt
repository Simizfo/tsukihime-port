` Never mind that and just eat.@

` Yeah, even if it's a bit past the expiration date, I wouldn't mind.@

`"Thanks for the meal."@
` I bring my hands together briefly and start to dig in to Senpai's lunch.@
` Munch, munch.@ I eat without restraint while Senpai stares at me.\

` Munch munch.\
` Munch.@ Munch.@ Munch.@
` Munch.@ Munch.@ Munch.@ Munch.\

`"----Mm."@
` I gulp some tea.@
` Senpai keeps watching me.\

`"Does it taste good?"@
`"Mm, it's cold and not very good."@
` …… I think that comment was a little too honest myself, but it's my personality, so I can't change it.@
` Senpai gives a small laugh as she looks directly into my eyes.@
`"Tohno-kun, you have quite a philosophic outlook."@
` She says this kindly.\

`"…… Huh?@ I don't get you, Senpai.@ Saying something like that all of a sudden."@
`"But it's true.@ Normally, people wouldn't eat another person's half-eaten lunch like that.@ But you don't seem to mind what others think of you, do you?"@
`"---?@ Really?@ I'm not that self-conscious."@

` I just live honestly.\

` But, if living life without caring what others think is philosophical, then this person is much more of a philosopher than I am.@
` If it was me---I could never mend the splints in the courtyard that everyone else ignores all by myself.\

`"In my opinion, I think you're more philosophical than I am, Senpai.@
` You're always living at your own pace.@ It feels so good just to watch."@
` I speak openly.@
` Of course it was a compliment, but Senpai says "Oh, I see," and slumps in disappointment.\

`"Um…… Senpai?@ Did I say something bad?"@
`"--Yes.@
` Because normally, that's what they call an old spinster.@ I'm a girl, so hearing that is a shock."@
` …… Hmmm.@ For Senpai, that must mean she's acting old rather than being philosophical.\

`"Oh yeah?@ So does that mean I'm acting like an old man now?@ Well excuse me, I'm just a high school student bravely facing the dangers of life."@
`"Ah, but you can't deny it.@ Because a sitting cushion and a cup of tea really suit you.@ Always calm, you seem like a retired man."@
` Senpai giggles.@
` …… I wanted to hear I was more a guy that looks good in Japanese clothing, but if Senpai says a retired man, then maybe that isn't a bad thing.\

`"Oh.@ Well then, fellow old-timer, how about we have a long chat over a cup of tea?"@
`"I'd love to keep you company, Shiki-san."@
` With a beaming smile, Senpai pours some tea into my tea cup.\

` An hour passes.@
` We talk together until five-thirty, then we walk out the gate before it closes and go our separate ways at the intersection.\
