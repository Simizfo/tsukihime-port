` Fifth period.@
` Feeling sleepy at the classics lecture, my gaze drifts outside the window.@
br
` ----And,
br
` a crow is perched on the classroom veranda.\
`"-----"@
` Not the blue crow from last night, but just an ordinary black one.@
` With its black eyes, the crow stares inside the classroom through the glass window.@
` It's true that it's unusual for a bird to perch there, but it's not like it's some major event.\

` The blood that's been building up inside the blood vessels in my brain forms black clots and slushes around inside my head, causing my vision to go black.@

` If I had to describe it, I would say it feels like darkness is pushing from my brain outwards towards my eyes.\

` It would have been better to go lie down in the infirmary, but at this hour, it'd be after school by the time I wake up.@

`"…… Phew.@ I think I'm feeling a little better."@
` I breathe in the outside air and feel a little rejuvenated.@
br
` …… Sheesh.@ I'm surprised at my own body.\
` Eight years ago.@
` The price of recovering from that near-fatal injury was becoming prone to sudden anemia.@
br
` When I first left the hospital, it would happen at least once a day.@ Collapsing from dizziness became a daily routine for me.@
` After some time, probably because my body had grown, the spontaneous dizziness and anemia became rarer.@
` But from time to time, things still trigger dizzy fits, and I still lose consciousness.@
` Today I was lucky that Arihiko caught me.@ Usually, I wind up passed out on the floor.@
` *sigh*@
` Taking a slow and deep breath, I draw fresh air into my lungs.@
` I can feel the blood pooled around the center of my head begin to swirl around again, so I head away from the school.\
