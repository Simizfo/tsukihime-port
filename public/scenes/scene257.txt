` ---How do I feel?@
` Certainly Senpai is dear to me.@ No matter who she is, the time we spent at school together is precious to me.@
br
` But, even still------to me, Senpai is Senpai.@
` Friend or foe, man or woman, before all of that, I only feel that she is my dependable Senpai.\

`"Come on!@ You can't fool me by being quiet, you know."@
` Arcueid continues glaring at me.@
` …… Come to think of it, no matter what kind of person Senpai is, this person is much, much scarier.@
` I've been forgetting, but she is a vampire, and she seems to lack knowledge of moral concepts.\


` ----But, I am still attracted to her.@
br
` Even tonight, I was simply looking for her, but I was getting so frustrated when I couldn't find her.@
` It was, something like feeling worried about a loved one.\

`"Shiki, I'll ask you one more time.@ Whose side are you on, mine or that woman's?"@
` Arcueid glares at me in irritation.\
`"…… Hey now, isn't that already decided?@ I'm still here.@ If I was on Senpai's side, I would have gone after her."@

`"Um, in other words---what do you mean?"@
` Arcueid tilts her head to the side questioningly.\

`"What do I mean?"@
br
` ---Why doesn't she just understand simple conversations?@
` If she's like this, unless I don't just say it directly, she'll never understand.\

`"You're pretty dense.@ Saying I'm still here means that----"@
br
` Means what?@
` The fact that I'm attracted to her is an undoubtable truth.@
` But I know that is something I must not say.@
` No matter how beautiful she is, it still doesn't change the fact that she's a vampire.\

`"You're going silent again, what are you trying to say?@ If you want to choose Ciel, then just say so!"@
`"I, I said that's not it!@ I keep saying it, but why don't you understand……!?"@

`"How can I know!"@
` Being screamed at irrationally, she screams back at me irrationally.\

`"Fine!@ Then I don't know you at all, Shiki!"@

`"Hey, hold on.@ Where are you going?"@
`"It has nothing to do with you.@ Don't follow me!"@
` Is she really that angry?@ Arcueid walks away without even turning around.\

`"Wha-----"@
` I stand in shock by myself in the park.@
` …… Arcueid got mad and went somewhere by herself, and I asked her what I wanted, so I know I should go back to the mansion.@
br
` …… But, my feet don't even move one step back.\
` My logic tells me where I should go, but my heart doesn't listen.\

` ---It's been said a million times, but.@
` The feelings of love and hate, they have nothing to do with logic.\

`"-----Man, geez!"@
br
` Damn it.@ Why is it that I just can't leave Arcueid alone……!?@
br
`"Arcueid!@ I said wait!"@
` Raising my voice, I chase after Arcueid who keeps on walking.\
