` ---The drinking continues.@
br
` I don't know how this happened, but it looks like the "Tohno Shiki Welcome Party" has turned into just a drinking party.\

` Akiha might be used to drinking, as she gulps down her glass as if she's drinking water.@
` Kohaku-san slowly drinks with Akiha while refilling Akiha's cup.@
` Seeing that their faces still look normal, I'm guessing they don't show drunkenness on their faces.\

` …… Incidentally, Hisui sits on the couch dizzily after drinking just one sip.\

`"…… Akiha really has quite a lot of tolerance."@
` Looking at the smiling Akiha and Kohaku-san, I gulp down my glass.@
` It is just water, as I only drank a mouthful of alcohol during the toast.@
` I take a bite of the smoked salmon on the table.@ It is exquisite.@ In the Tohno house, even the snacks are first class.\

`"……………… Mmm."@
` Even though there might be a lot of problems, it is pretty enjoyable right now.@
` To be blunt, Akiha and Kohaku-san's conversation is outright boring.@ It's as if they were just discussing how the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.@
` Despite that, it all seems rather charming seeing them laughing at those kinds of conversations.\

`"………………"@
` On the other hand, Hisui is holding the glass she used during the toast and gazing vacantly.@
` Whenever I look away from Hisui, the glass becomes a little more empty.@ …… She seems to be enjoying herself, too.\

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` I sneak another bite of food.@
` I'm pretty weak against alcohol, so I prefer to eat the finger food instead.@
` …… And.@
`"…………?"@
` What happened?@
` Akiha stands up and walks over to me.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Nii-san.@ You've only been eating, you aren't going to drink any?"@
` Akiha looks at me a little dissatisfied.\

`"…… Now look, I don't care if you get drunk, but you shouldn't try to make others drink at your pace.@ I'm not used to drinking a lot, so if you want to drink with someone, Kohaku-san can-----"@
` I try to point over to Kohaku-san, but…
` She isn't there.@ It seems like she went to get some more alcohol from the kitchen.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well excuuuse me!@ I'm not the slightest bit drunk."@
` Raising her glass with one hand, Akiha leans forward.@
`"…… I see.@ Since Kohaku-san isn't here……"@
` I guess she's messing with me since she has no one to talk to.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Kohaku doesn't have anything to do with this.@ We are talking about why you are not drinking."@
`"…… Well, I have been drinking…"@
`"That's a lie.@ I, haven't had a chance to pour you anything.@
` I was drinking so that you could relax, but all you have been doing is munching away at the food Kohaku made.@ You haven't even had one glass, right?"@
` Akiha pouts.@
` Is it just me or is her step a little unsteady?\

`"Akiha, I just have to ask, are you drunk?"@
`"Don't be ridiculous.@ I'm not drunk at all.@ You will be dead drunk long before I will."@
`"…… You are dead drunk."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hurry up and finish your glass.@ I will listen to whatever you have to say when you are done."@
` She points commandingly at my glass.@
` Except her finger is wobbling all over.\


`"…… Akiha, I've said this before, but you really are drunk."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t07b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Sheesh----!@ You really are persistent.@ I told you I'm not drunk!"@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Akiha yells and wobbles back.@
` …… Her own voice causes her to get dizzy, so what part of that isn't being drunk?\

`"…… Oh well.@ Have a seat, we can chat a bit, I suppose."@
` I pat the sofa next to me.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t13b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Ah…… yes, I'll sit."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Akiha sits down on the sofa.\

` I don't know where all her bossiness disappeared to, but she just meekly sits down.@
`"…………………………"@
`"…………………………"@
` For some reason, I suddenly don't feel comfortable.@
`"……………… Hmm."@
` Resigned, I pick up my glass.@
` I take a light gulp.@
` The unfamiliar alcohol burns my throat; it doesn't taste good at all.@
` I feel the ground dip beneath me, as if I was feeling dizzy from my anemia.\

`"……………"@
` But, I can't say that this feels bad, either.@
` I might as well just finish it off, so I down the rest of it.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"…… I'm surprised.@ You may have said differently before, but you sure seem to like drinking, Nii-san."@
`"What do you mean?@ I'm not a big drinker or anything."@
`"It doesn't look like it.@ You were drinking that rather happily."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Akiha leans over and takes a bottle from the table.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"I'll water it down, but do you have any other preferences?"@
` Akiha pours me some whiskey without asking.@
` Common sense demands that I stop her.@
` But she seems so happy, I throw aside any thoughts of common sense.\

`"…… Please water it down a lot.@ Otherwise, I won't be able to drink it."@
`"As you say.@ Well, then let's start, shall we?"@
` Akiha happily fills my glass.@
`"………… Man, I don't even drink this much when I'm with Arihiko."@
` I lean back on the sofa.@ I down the glass with my neck tilted so far back that I can see the ceiling.@
` I drink what Akiha poured me slowly without letting my mouth go from the glass.\

`"---Phew.@ Well, are you satisfied, princess?"@
` I place the empty glass on the table.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t08b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"That's the way to do it.@ I have to take points off for not drinking it fast, but it's still a passing grade."@
`"You're pretty strict.@ That was my new record, you know.@ You told me to drink it, so I pushed myself."@
`"Really?@ This is pretty rare, you keeping me company like this, Nii-san."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` She chuckles.@
` Pouring herself another glass, she downs it.\

` -----My heart beats loudly at the sight of her face.@
br
` She looks so mature when she is drinking.@
` She closes her eyes and tilts her head back.@
` Seeing her white throat voluptuously gulp down the alcohol, I forget about being drunk.@

`"-----Aaah."@
` Akiha lets out a deep breath.@ The glass is empty.@
` …… She says under her breath something to the effect that it is delicious.\

`"………………"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t08b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"?@ What is it, Nii-san.@ Is there something on my face?"@
`"Ah----nothing, it's nothing."@
` Without thinking, I pick up my glass.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Another one?@ This time, we'll have something a little bit stronger."@
` Akiha fills up the glasses again.@
` …… I didn't really want another glass, but I suppose it won't hurt.\

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

`"…………………… Mmm."@
` Trying to imitate Akiha, I drink it all in one gulp.@
` It wasn't that much alcohol, but I shouldn't have drank it that fast.@
` My head starts to spin and I fall back on the sofa.\

`"Nii-san---?@ Are, are you alright……!?"@
`"Ah, I'm fine.@ I just got a little dizzy, but I'm not drunk.@ I think I'll rest for a little bit.@ You go ahead and have fun."@
` Laying back on the sofa, I stare aimlessly at the ceiling.@
` Even though I feel completely drained, I feel incredibly good.\

`"…… I'm sorry.@ I… forced you to drink too much."@
` Akiha's voice sounds very sad.@
`"No, maybe it was a little much, but it feels good.@ I drank it because you drank it so deliciously.@ I guess the result is alright though.@
` So, go ahead and keep drinking.@ Once I settle down, I'll join you again."@
`"---Okay.@ If you say so, I will wait until you are done."@
` I hear the sound of something pouring.@
` As expected, she pours another glass and drinks it.\

`"……………………"@
` …… That's odd.@ This isn't anything much, but---I feel incredibly relaxed here.\

`"…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… Alright!"@
` Taking a breath, I get up from the sofa.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Nii-san?@ Are you feeling better?"@
`"I'm fine.@ I'll keep you company a little bit more."@
` I give her my glass.@
` Smiling, she pours me another drink.@ This time, I decide to drink at my own pace.\


cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


` …… Time passes by.@
` Hisui has fallen asleep on the sofa.@
` Kohaku-san never did come back from the kitchen.@
` The only ones still moving about are me and Akiha, but I am pretty drunk, so I wouldn't necessarily call myself moving about.@
` But still, I want to keep Akiha company until Kohaku-san returns.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t26.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"…… Nii-san.@ You are very kind today."@
` Akiha says this suddenly, in a small voice.@
`"-----Eh?@ Kind?@ Me?"@
`"Yes.@ Normally, you are a very cold person.@ Acting kind like this is very rare, isn't it?"@
`"……………… Really?@ I don't really know, but maybe I am cold."\

`"…… Oh, Nii-san, you don't understand yourself very well.@ You are a very kind person, but at the same time, you are very cold.@
` …… Because you make no distinction between people.@ You don't have anyone that you like the most, no matter if you hate them or like them.@ Nii-san, you like and forgive everyone."\

`"…… But that is very cruel to the people who want to be closest to you.@ For you, everyone is the same.@ Me, Kohaku, Hisui… we are all the same for you.@
` That isn't kindness.@ Like an old dog that knows its time of death is near, you simply don't want to leave anything behind.@
` …… You were like that back then, but now, how do you say it…… you seem very dangerous, and that makes me uneasy."@
` Downcast, Akiha continues to speak, almost as if she was thinking aloud.@
` Her glass is empty.@ She doesn't fill it, and her quiet voice echoes in the air.\

`"…… Hey.@ I just thought that you were maybe inconsiderate and very lonely… I was just thinking something stupid like that.@
` There isn't anyone you hold dearest in your heart.@ Maybe you lost that person a long time ago.@
` Back then, I thought that if you just liked me, that would be fine.@ At least there wasn't anyone you liked the most, so that was good enough.@
` …… But now, it is----"\

`"Ah……"@
` Akiha suddenly swallows her words, and with a sigh, pours herself more to drink.\

`"Hey, Nii-san, please drink some more as well.@ It's just me drinking now."@
` Taking the bottle that Kohaku-san brought, she pours some more drink into my glass.\

`"No, I've had enough.@ I've had twice as much as normal, so please let me pass on this one.@ If I do drink more, I really will end up in bad shape."@
`"What are you saying?@ You haven't even had a bottle yet.@ It's way too early to say you've had enough.@ You said you'd drink with me, right?"@
` "Come on," she says and holds out my glass.@
` But, I really am at my limit.\

` Shiki-san, you should say no or you'll be in trouble.@ Akiha-sama doesn't get drunk no matter how much she drinks, so if you keep drinking with her until she's happy, you'll end up drinking until dawn."@

` Smiling, Kohaku-san serves Akiha another drink, who starts to sip it slowly.\

` It has gotten pretty late.@
` Hisui woke up eventually and we talked about unimportant things.@
` It's probably the fault of the alcohol, but I don't remember what we talked about at all.@
` Just meaningless, warm conversation.@
` Because I wasn't used to that kind of stuff, I settled into an insecure comfort, like hanging from a silken thread.@
` It's probably because of that.@
` On one hand, I thought it would be nice for this to continue, but on the other hand, I wanted a little time to myself.\

`"…… Kohaku-san.@ About that subject earlier, isn't it natural for me to come back here to my own home?@ I couldn't leave Akiha all alone, and I couldn't burden the Arimas forever."@
`"So, that is your reason for coming back."@
` Kohaku-san seems like she understands.@
` ---But, that is a lie.@
` There is another reason---something more important than Akiha.\

`"Shiki-san?@ What is it?"@
`"…… Oh, it's different, Kohaku-san.@ Really, there is another important reason."@
`"Really?@ Does that mean it is a secret?"@
`"…… I don't know.@ It isn't that it's a secret, but it's an important memory I have that I don't want to talk about.@

` I collapse on the bed.@
` It's probably the fault of the alcohol, as I start to feel very sleepy.@
`"……………………"@
` It's probably because I said those words to Kohaku-san.@
` I start to think about the promise I made eight years ago.\

` ----You can never come back to this mansion ever again.@
br
` I still remember the time when my father said those words to me, and my feelings as I left my room.@
` That time when I realized that I would be all alone, just like I was before I met Sensei.@
` Not being able to keep my promise with Sensei, I guess I became empty inside.@
` That time, the girl I spoke with only once.@
` …… that was my only saving grace.@
` I don't know what kind of magic was in those words.\

`"Give it back, okay?" …… Just those words.@
br
` But to me, those words meant so much back then.@
` I---always thought those words were important.@
` …… Well, it seems that Hisui forgot she ever said them though.\

`"…… Oh well, it can't be helped.@ It was just a promise we made as children."@
` It is a shame, but it really can't be helped.@
` Eight years is a long time.@
` Actually remembering a promise from your childhood is stranger than forgetting it, I suppose.@

` I speak with him for another hour.@
` We ramble about nothing as we watch cars go by.@
` The most pointless thing was probably our special powers.@
` My eyes that can see death.@
` His body that dies with great difficulty.@
` We began by discussing their principles.@
`"…… I see.@ Well, does that mean you can kill the five senses?"@
` He says such nonsense.\

`"I can't do that.@ I can't kill something so vague that needs an expression to be understood."@
`"Not at all.@ Look, if you wanted to kill sight, kill the eyes.@ Hearing, kill the ears.@ I can do at least that much…
` But you're different.@ You can kill things without crushing them.@ The moment you see those lines, you can kill.@ Not the object, but its very meaning.@
` That's why----something beyond the five senses, like the sixth sense…… spirit and emotion, you should be able to kill those things too."\

`"……………………… Hmm."@
` …… Well, he has a point.@
` My eyes themselves are an aberration.@
` Using logic to understand them is a mistake from the start.@
br
` …… Then can I kill that too?@
` That apparition that I saw once in my childhood.@
` That haunting thing called Crimson Red Vermillion.\

`"But, that seems hard.@ If I do that, I don't know how much longer I could stay sane."@
`"Yeah.@ It's like trying to calculate as a god using the mind of a human.@ You'd cripple yourself for sure."@
` He says this as he walks toward the vending machine again.\

`"Hey."@
` Still looking at the vending machine, he holds his hand behind him towards me.@
` I toss him a coin, which he catches skillfully and uses to buy another can of coffee.@

` After drinking this, he turns to me again.@

`"It really has been a long time since I talked to another person."@

br
` That's really weird.\

`"…… That's strange, were you stranded on an island somewhere?"@
`"Huh?@ I'm still stranded on this island.@ It seems I'm out of alignment with society.@ They say someone who kills people for no reason is just crazy.@
` There's really no way someone like me, who's out of tune, could have a conversation with someone in tune."\

`"…… Hmm.@ So we're out of tune?"@
`"Yeah.@ It's not a matter of who's off tune.@ Those out of tune with society are the ones out of tune."@
`"Really?@ Maybe society is the one out of tune instead."@
`"What do you mean by that?"@
`"Exactly what I said.@ Didn't you say that just now?@
` It's like majority rule.@ The views of the minority that aren't the same as the views of the majority are said to be "unusable" and rejected.@
` It doesn't matter who is right or wrong.@ If you don't fit in, you're left out, regardless of if you are right or wrong.@ The term 'out of tune' doesn't follow universal rules."\

`"-----Heh, so are you trying to say that killers like us aren't evil?"@
`"…… Who knows?@ I don't know about good or evil.@ But if you think about it logically, we aren't the ones out of tune.@
` …… Let's see, how about using boxers as an example?@ It doesn't have to be boxers, but it is an easy example to understand."\

`"Boxers, their job is to punch people.@ But not just to punch people.@ They painfully cut weight, and train every day to skillfully punch people.@ To effectively punch others, to efficiently defeat others.@ They diligently work on it every day, like sharpening a blade.@
` What do you think of that?"@
`"…… Huh.@ There are people like that.@ And?"\

`"No, that's all.@
` They just punch each other, but they don't kill their opponents.@ Sure, some could die from accidents, but it isn't considered murder.@ Isn't that incredible?"@
br
`"---You mean it's okay to kill?"@
br
`"No, no.@ You aren't supposed to kill.@ But you could.@ Isn't that a huge contradiction?@ That's not all, because a boxer's fist is considered a weapon, they aren't allowed to fight outside the ring."\

`"…… This is incredible.@ They know a boxer's fist is a weapon, so why is there such a profession in the first place?@ If it's a weapon that can kill, they should abolish it.@
` Killing is wrong, killing is wrong.@
` But this world is full of tools to kill.@ Even the law allows it.@ But they say it's not alright to kill; this can only be considered chaos.@ If common sense is what is thought of as good by a majority of people, then we aren't out of tune.@
` If there is anything out of tune, it's this world."\

` …… All that said, I don't necessarily hate boxing.@
` There are a lot of professions out there, but there aren't any others where you can be so stoic about your objectives.@
` You strengthen yourself by cutting yourself off from all temptations.@
` Humans are interested in strength they can easily comprehend.@ That's why competitions will never go away.@
` Of all of these competitions, the ones people like the most are where the contestants hurt each other.\

` Admiration of the strong.@
` A mindset that can only be drawn towards strength.@
` That is probably a very healthy mind.@
` As guys like him and I can think only of results, our colors might be similar, but our shapes should be completely different.\

` Something you can concentrate on and forget yourself.@
` That doesn't become an individual's free will.@
` Those that worship education, those who immolate themselves in art, those who advance themselves in business.@
` If an individual could decide that, then this world would be a pretty puzzle that could be understood.@
` But this puzzle is full of holes.@
` Pieces are missing, and a lot of pieces don't fit.\

`"I see.@ You like to talk a lot, don't you.@ I had a friend like that once.@
` How do I say this…… well, he didn't have anything, which is why he looked like he didn't want anything.@
` To me, he seemed very isolated.@ Isolation is just another name for loneliness, right?@ That is why it bugged me."@
`"…… Hmm.@ Didn't want anything?@ What about you?@ Is there something you want?"@
`"…… I don't know.@ I think I used to, but I can't remember now.@ What about you?"\

`"Everyone wants something, but I haven't found anything worth dreaming for.@
` A fire within me that caused me to lose my mind---tonight was maybe my first time feeling that."@
`"Hahaha.@ That means you're a killer too."@
`"…… I don't know.@ I can't be sure yet.@ What about you, is killing fun?"@
`"----Are you stupid?@ If it was fun, I'd be doing it non-stop.@ There isn't any reason.@ Once you start, you just get hooked."\

` …… I see.@
` I think I understand a little bit.@
` In other words, it's not a matter of liking or disliking the murder.@ It's a matter of when he does kill someone, whether he can devote himself to that action.@
br
` That's probably the difference between being in or out of tune.\

`"Hey, didn't you ever take apart a radio when you were a kid?"@
`"Ray Dio……?@ I never killed any one like that."@
`"---Right, thanks for being a moron.@ To be honest, that was a joke.@ Animate objects and inanimate objects are completely different.@ Maybe people like us should be doctors instead."@

` …… Is that so?@
` I have my own doctor, so I take medicine like it was nothing.\

`"-----Ahh, it really was a lot of fun."@
` He stands up.@
br
` And----with empty eyes, he looks down at me.@

`"---Well.@ We don't need two of us in this town, right?@ Two lions in a cage this small won't even be able to mark their own territory."@
` He looks like he is going for his knife.@
` The inorganic reek of murder.@
` He really does want a fight to the death.\

`"You shouldn't."@
` I say quite naturally.@
`"Why?"@
`"Well, as a living creature, you're stronger than me, but…"@

`"I'm superior to you."\

`"------,------"@
` He grinds his teeth.@
` After a twitching smile,
`"Ha…… aha, aahahhaha……!!"@
` He laughs extremely loudly.\

`"What?@ Was it that funny, killer?"@
` Hee hee hee, heeheehee.@ The man continues to laugh.@
` …… Just when I thought I'd just have to leave him, he stops laughing and looks at me.@
br
`"----You're right, you know."@
br

`"…… I don't really intend to take your place."@
`"No, no, it's useless.@ You got hooked tonight, right?@ Then it'll be the same tomorrow.@ You won't be able to endure, even for a day.@
` Well, I hope we won't meet again."@
` Raising a hand, he disappears.\

`"--------"@
` Hearing that we wouldn't meet again, I get a little sad.@
` At my feet, there are about ten cans of coffee that he drank.@
` In other words, he'll never pay me back for these.\
