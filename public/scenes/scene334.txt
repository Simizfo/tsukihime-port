` I walk with Akiha towards the mansion.@
`"……"@
` Frankly, it's difficult.@
` If I look beside me, I can see Akiha walking with her long hair fluttering.@
` Akiha is silent and graceful, the perfect daughter of a respected family.\

`"………"@
` Why can't I think of anything to say?@
` Even though I see Akiha at home every day, I somehow feel some tension walking home toward the mansion.\

` We arrive at the mansion.@
` Akiha steps forward to open the gate, but as if remembering something, turns to me.@

`"…… I have one question.@ How close are you to that person called Ciel, Nii-san?"@
` Abruptly, she asks an extremely forward question.@
`"Not especially close.@ We're just friends from school.@ She… feels like someone I can talk to."@

`"Really?" Akiha says, turning away and going through the gates.\

` We cross the courtyard and arrive at the door.@
` As Hisui is not waiting at the gates and Kohaku is not sweeping the garden, there is no sign of either of them today.\

`"Ah."@

`"Yes?@ Did you say something, Nii-san?"@
`"Well, nothing much but… I'd like to go and take a look at the Japanese-style building you were talking about, if that's okay."@
`"----The detached building?"@
` Murmuring, Akiha's brow creases with concern.\

`"Please, do not.@ It was sealed up many years ago.@ Nii-san, even you are not permitted to go there."@

` Having stated this, Akiha goes into the mansion.\
