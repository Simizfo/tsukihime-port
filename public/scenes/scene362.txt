`"Ha----ahh…!!!!!"@
` I collapse backwards onto the hallway floor.@
` I don't have time to feel pain.@
` If I don't stand up immediately, I'll be killed.@
` But it's too late.@
` The moment I get up, Senpai is right in front of me.\

` The dagger strikes down at my heart.@
`"------!"@
` I was just, desperate.@
` In desperation, I try to match her blow by placing my knife next to Senpai's neck.@

br
` ---Then.@
` Senpai's dagger stops short.\

`"Haghh---"@
` Breathing.@ My breathing is, hard.@
` *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*…
` Her dagger is aimed at my throat.@
` If Senpai moves her hand even slightly, I'll die instantly.@
`"Ha… ah…"@
` That fact.@
` Just that causes me to go insane.\

`"---It's over.@ Even if you stab that knife through my neck, I won't die."@
`"Wha---what are…"@
`"You said before that you saw it.@ Even though my body was pierced by an iron pipe, my body heals the wound instantly.@ …… Certainly if you stab me through the neck I'll be dead for a while, but I'll kill you before that."@
`"-----Wha."@
` What she says is true.@
` …… There's no sense in lying in a situation like this.@
br
` In other words.@
` This situation where both of us hold each other's life in each other's hands is meaningless.\

`"Won't---die…?"@
` …… Ah, but it could be true.@
` Even injured like that, Senpai came to school like normal.@
br
`"---Kuh."@
` But, screw all that.@
` I can see "death" on her body.@
` Although it's very different from other people's, I can still see her death.@
` So, killing her is easy.@
` The "lines" have no exceptions.\

`"If you don't believe me, please, use your knife… In any case, you can't save yourself unless you kill me.@ Shall we test it out?"@
`"------"@
` ……She's provoking me.@
` If I can be killed, kill me, she's saying.@
` But Senpai, provocation like that is fatal.@
` I'm not like the others----I can really kill you.\

` ----My heart beats.@
br
` If I look down, her dagger is at my chest.@
` …… I have to kill.@
` Because I don't want to die.@
` I found out I shouldn't die that easily, so I can't let myself be killed.@
br
` No, it's simpler than that.@
` I just, don't want to die.\


` ----My heart beats.@
br
` So there's only one answer.@
` Kill.@
` Drive this knife into the "line" I see in Ciel's neck, and kill her.@
` Kill if you want to live.@
` Kill.@ Kill.@ Kill.@ Kill.@ Kill.@ Kill---
