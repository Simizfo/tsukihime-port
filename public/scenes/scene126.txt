` ………, ………………, ……………………@
br
`"--Mor--ning?"@
` I dazedly open my eyes.@
` Sunshine pours in from the window, enveloping the room with a warm atmosphere.\

`"………………"@
` I stare down at my hands.@
` They are a little sweaty.@ My body is drenched in sweat as well, as if last night was incredibly hot.@
` What's more, I'm panting heavily.\

`"……………… Um."@
` …… Alright, I need to calm down.@
` First, I catch my breath and then close my eyes.@
` This is my room.@
` It is before seven in the morning.@
` I am the only one here, and of course Senpai is nowhere to be found.@
br
` Just as she said,
` it was all a dream.\

`"………"@
` Yeah, I know.@
` I know it was a dream.@ Now that I'm calm, I know she wouldn't ever do anything like that.@
` Then that means… what happened last night was not real.\

`"Hhaa--ahhhh."@
` I let out a deep breath.@
` …… All the same, I definitely still feel vestiges of her touch lingering on my body.@
` Like the sensation of her breasts as she embraced me from behind in her underwear, and her dancing fingers on my penis.@
` I know it was a dream--but it felt too real; it makes me think it was real.\

` …… All the same, it has got to be a dream.@
` I can't tell if that's something I should be happy or disappointed about, but it's just all my imagination anyway.@
` But,\

`"--Why--"@
` Why did I see that kind of dream?@
` I know Senpai is my important friend; but does having a dream like that mean I see her as a woman too?\

`"----Uh."@
` Just thinking of it, the overly real memory of her skin rushes back.@
` To make sure I'm not still dreaming, I hug myself.@
` …… Yeah, this is definitely real.@
` Her skin was so fundamentally different from a guy's skin like this… so soft, so warm.\
`"…… And she was really mean."\

` --Just thinking about it makes my breath go wild.@
` …… Well, maybe I went through a lot of bad things, but it's true that it did feel exceedingly good.@
` I should feel a bit guilty dreaming about doing that to Senpai, but I recall the dream and just sit there thinking about it.@
br
` But then,\

`"Shiki-sama."@
`"Uwaaaaaa!"@
quakey 2,100

` I flail around off my bed as if trying to escape.@
` No--in fact I was trying to escape, but it just ended up with me landing on the floor with the sheets.\

`"Hi, Hihi, Hisui…… !?@ H, how long have you been there!?"@
`"Since before you awoke, Shiki-sama."@
` She speaks with her usual lack of expression.@
` Still lying on the floor tangled in the sheets and unable to stand, I look up at Hisui's face.\

`"…… Before I… woke up……"@
br
` --Then, that means…
` Hisui saw my face when I was having that dream?@
br
` My face turns deep red.\

` Hisui just stands there, expressionless as usual, and makes no attempt to speak.@
`"Um…… did I look… strange……?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I do not wish to describe it."@
`"Ah--h"@
` …… I knew it.@ I must have looked really weird.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"But, if you insist, Shiki-sama, I can describe as accurately as I can."@
`"…… No, you don't have to do that……"@
` My face still flushed, I speak in a fading voice.\

`"Um, Hisui-san?"@
` I give a cough to clear the silence.@
` …… Adding "san" to her name is a clear sign of my vulnerability.\


`"What is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Um…… I'm going to change, so would you mind waiting outside?"@
` --Or rather, I'm so embarrassed I just want her to leave.@
` But Hisui doesn't obey today of all days.\

`"Once I can confirm you are awake, I will leave the room, Shiki-sama."@
`"……!"@
` Huh?@ Is, is is is she joking!?@
` Why does she think I'm covering myself up in these sheets!?@
` It's to hide something that's still standing!\

`"I, I'm fine, so please leave.@ I can get up, and I won't go back to sleep.@ I'll change and go to the sitting room as soon as you leave."@
`"Shiki-sama--Are you hurt and unable to stand……?"@
` Hisui approaches me out of worry.\
cl c,%type_crossfade_mid

`"No, that's not it.@ I'm standing----I mean I can stand, so don't worry about it."@
` I crawl pulling my sheets like a slug, and gain some distance from her.@
br
` Using the bed as a barrier, I get far enough away.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Then, please excuse me.@ I will prepare your breakfast, so please come after you change."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` She has got to be suspicious, but she bows and leaves the room.\

` *sigh*@
` I was so surprised.@
` The contents of my dream were surprising enough, but knowing Hisui saw me while I was dreaming is very troubling.@
` …… Or is it my own fault for having that kind of dream about Senpai?\

`"…… I guess it is my fault.@ With a good person like Senpai--why did I have a dream like that?"@
` I give a sigh of self-loathing.@
` But, I can tell that I won't forget that dream any time soon.\

` After calming down sufficiently, I head to the sitting room.@

`"Yeah, good morning.@ There were, well, a lot of things going on this morning."@
` As soon as I say that--I suddenly recall the memory of Senpai's tongue.\

`"Uh--"@

`"Nii-san--?"@
` A brief clamor.@

` Akiha sighs.@
`"You do seem to have a fever.@ Kohaku, come quickly.@ Nii-san doesn't seem to be well."@
` Akiha calls out to the dining room.@
` Kohaku-san has to be preparing my breakfast in the kitchen.\

`"I'm fine--!@ It's just a minor cold, so don't worry!"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"If it is a cold, then I can't let it go by.@ For you, a trivial illness is a big deal.@ The strength of your immune system is much lower than most people's."@

` Akiha seems to be fed up and puts her hand on my forehead.@
br
` The sensation of her cool, delicate hand--

`"!!!!!!!!"@
` This isn't good.@
` This isn't good at all, so I break loose and run out to the lobby.\

`"I have your bag here.@ Are you already going to school?"@

`"Leave you alone--hey, Nii-san!?"@

`"Sigh----"@
` Even if it is Akiha, she wouldn't chase me this far.\
` Since we're not kids anymore, she won't stop me from going to school.\

`"----Whew."@
`  I take a deep breath and am finally able to calm down.@
`"……… What am I running away for?"@
` Once I calm down, I can think clearly.@
` I didn't do anything wrong, so there was no need for me to run away like that.\

`"--I don't believe it.@ I look like a complete idiot."@
` But, to go back to the mansion to eat breakfast sounds more dumb.@
`"--To school, then?"@
` Letting out a sigh, I go downhill along the residential street.\
