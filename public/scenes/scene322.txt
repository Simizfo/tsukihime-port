` -----And…
br
` In less than an hour, Hisui falls asleep and Kohaku-san carries her to her room with a smile.\

`"…………"@
` Not being used to alcohol, my mind is a little fuzzy.@
` Akiha sits nearby and is still drinking eagerly.@ It doesn't bode well for the rest of the evening.@
`"…… Akiha, you really have some tolerance, don't you."@

`"Oh?@ I'm not drinking it straight up so I think it is about normal."@
` …… Um, that's not the point…
` I'm saying she's pretty used to drinking for being a minor.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t13b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Geez, making that face again.@ Please get at least a little drunk, Nii-san.@
` Kohaku prepared all this to cheer you up, so isn't it meaningless if you don't?"@
`"Ah, that's right.@ …… Yeah, I have to thank Kohaku-san for her consideration.@ Thanks to that, I do feel a bit better."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What are you saying?@ You don't look happy at all.@ If alcohol doesn't make you feel better, isn't there nothing left?"@
`"Wow, that's a little bold.@ Saying nothing is left if alcohol doesn't work… isn't that mistaken?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"It cannot be helped if you do not wish to speak to me, Nii-san.@ If you would talk about last night, I wouldn't ask for the help of alcohol."@
`"------"@
` I see.@
` Just like Kohaku-san, Akiha is concerned about me.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t16b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"But, I can't ask, right?@ I already promised no longer to ask about it."@
`"…… Sorry.@ I'm just a big burden to everyone."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t26.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well, as long as you understand it is alright.@
` ----Um, as you say I seem to be a little drunk, so I will go outside."@

` Following Akiha, I go out to the courtyard to get some fresh air.@
` It is still before six o'clock.@
` The red sun paints the sky.@
`"…… Still the afternoon?"@
` There's no one else around.@
` I thought Akiha was going to be here but I guess we missed each other.\

`"…… Red sunset?"@
` Until now, the red sunset reminded me of fresh blood.@
` But today,
` it reminded me of her final smile as we parted on the road home.@

` …… My house is this way.@
` Saying that, she went down a different path.\

` …… Thanks.@
` She probably said that since I was there for her until the very end.\
br
` …… Sorry.@
` She probably said that since she knew I would carry this regret from now on.\

` …… So it's okay to forget.@
br
` It felt like she whispered those words in my ears.\
` …… Isn't that just a false happiness?@
` In a dream I dreamed about, I dream such selfish words.\

` If I can just forget, it will be very easy for me.@
` But I can't forget.@
` I didn't like her nor did I hate her, but,
` I think I shouldn't forget her smile.@
` And more than that,
` as long as this scar remains on my neck, I can't forget----\

` …… Ah, I remember now.@
` That had to have been more than eight years ago.@
` Akiha came to watch over me after I caught a cold or something like that.\

` It really was a terrible cold; even breathing was painful.@
` The black-haired girl sat by my pillow, holding my hand and just staring at me.@
` Tatami and the shouji.@
` The cool winter air.@
` In the dark tatami mat room, the young figure of Akiha watching me on the verge of tears.\

` Did she sneak away from Makihisa?@ Akiha snuck in and cried as she held my hand.@
` "I'm sorry," she was saying.@
` I didn't know why, but the black-haired young girl kept repeating "I'm sorry" over and over.\

` ------I remember.@
br
` About the proud eldest daughter of the Tohno family who was the only one to care for me.\

`"………………"@
` The young girl always crying in the dark Japanese room.@ I bit my tongue in frustration while being dizzy from fever.@
` I wonder why she was crying.@
` If it was me,
` I would never, never let Akiha cry.\


` …… I'm sorry.@
` …… I'm sorry, Shiki-nii-san.@

` Her tears were simply beautiful.@
` Since that time, I vowed to be her real brother----\
