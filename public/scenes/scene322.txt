`"Well then, a toast to Shiki-san's homecoming.@ Everyone, please take whatever you would like to drink."@
` Kohaku lines up drinks in front of us, with a full smile entirely free of malice.@

` Most of the drinks didn't happen to be juice or anything like that, but proper alcoholic beverages.\

`"…… Uh, Akiha?"@

`"Hm?@ What is it, Nii-san?"@
` …… There's a gurgling as Akiha fills her glass with a tawny liquid, then adds a little orange juice.@
`"Tha… that wouldn't be whiskey, would it?"@
`"It would.@ Is there something wrong?"@
`"'It would' …?@ Akiha…"@
` Um, aren't we all too young to be drinking…?\

`"This is your welcoming party.@ We have to have alcohol, don't we?@
` Or… Nii-san, you're weak when it comes to alcohol?"@
` Akiha seems… somehow delighted.\

` ----Huh.@
` Well, it can't be helped.@ A lot of alcohol isn't good for my body, but a little bit should be okay.@
` The weakest drink laid out on the table is---the wine, it looks like.\

`"Well then, everyone, raise your glasses, please?@
` Cheers!"@

` With a clash, our glasses come together.@ Kohaku tosses hers down in a single gulp, Akiha takes her time, and Hisui sips hers quietly.@

` …… Oh man, I'm not responsible for this.\
