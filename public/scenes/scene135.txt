` At lunch break, that guy who didn't even show up for a single class arrives.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t05.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Yo Tohno!@ Food, let's get some food!"@
` He's happy about something, being even more energetic than usual.\
`"Of course, food.@ But you seem to be in a great mood.@ Did something happen, Arihiko?"@
`"Yup.@ I just asked Senpai if she wanted to eat lunch together, and she refused."@
`"………………"@
` That's odd.@
` "Senpai" must be referring to Ciel-senpai, but this guy seems to get happy when his offer is refused.\

`"Hey, Arihiko, you have that sort of taste?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, no, I'm not finished.@ So I asked Senpai why not, and she said 'If Tohno-kun is there, then I don't want to come'!!@ Uwahahahahahahahaha!@ Isn't that great, Tohno!?"@
`"……………"@
` That's odd.@
` Why have I been friends with this guy since middle school?\

`"Oh man, she really hates you Tohno!@ A rival's loss is my gain, so I'll treat you to lunch today!"@
` Arihiko happily slaps my back.@
`"…… I see.@ Senpai's still mad at me about this morning."@
` I have no idea why she's angry at me, but she definitely is angry.@

`"Hey, let's go Tohno.@ There's only seats enough for half the people using the cafeteria."@
` Arihiko takes me by the arm and drags me off.\

` I sit next to Arihiko and eat my lunch.@
` My school's cafeteria has a television, and for better or worse for our education, they play back the morning news they recorded this morning.@
br
` At any rate, the news they are playing back is talking about a drunk customer stabbing to death a convenience store employee, something that makes me not want to go to a convenience store for a few days at least.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What a dangerous world we live in.@ Indiscriminate serial killers, drunken people stabbing people.@ A man can't even feel safe playing around at night anymore."@
` Arihiko seems like he is seriously watching the news.\

`"…… Well, certainly it is dangerous.@ But at least those serial killings won't happen anymore, so things should be like usual."@
`"Oh really?@ Did they catch the serial killer?"@
`"No, they haven't caught him…"@
br
` ---But Nrvnqsr is no longer in this world.@
` So the stupid title of the modern day vampire killings shouldn't be showing up in the news anymore and there will be no more of those meaningless killings.\

`"Anyway, those terrible incidents won't happen anymore.@ There won't be any more victims, and the streets will be back to normal."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No----I think there'll actually be another victim, Tohno."@
`"----What?@ How can you be so sure, Arihiko?"@
`"Well look for yourself.@ The news says they've found the tenth dead body."@
br
` -----Eh?@
br
`"Aw really…… that's right behind the movie theater I always go to."\

`"Hey----hey, wait."@
` I push Arihiko and look at the TV.@
` What I see is without a doubt,
` the news reporting that the tenth victim of the serial killings was found last night.@

playstop

`"That----can't be."@
` He, Nrvnqsr, is dead.@
` So why----is there another dead body with most of its blood drained?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hmm, this modern vampire guy.@ I don't know anything about the person, but if it's like a sexy chick, I maybe wouldn't mind getting my blood sucked."@
`"------"@
br
` If it's like a sexy chick, he maybe wouldn't mind getting his blood sucked?@
br
` His stupid talk----might be right.@
br
`"----No way."@
` I don't want to think about it, but…
` Even with Nrvnqsr gone, there's still one more vampire left, Shiki----\

` Classes end and school is over.@
` Actually, it's more like at some point, school was over.@
` Wrapped up in my bad thoughts, I look up and suddenly find myself alone.\

`"----The serial killings are still happening."@
` I don't know what that means.@
` The only one who knows the answer is probably Arcueid.@
br
` I don't know.@
` I'm not involved in any of those incidents anymore.@
` Once I settled things with Nrvnqsr, I came back to the ordinary world.@
` Then----I can only be insane to want to go back to that abnormal world once again.\

`"I shouldn't----be involved."@
br
` I understand even if I don't say it.@
` That's probably my second most correct choice.@
` But a long, long time ago, someone taught me the most correct choice.\
br
br
br
br
br
` ----Listen, Shiki.@ Every person's life is filled with pitfalls.@
` You have more power to do something about it than most people, so you've got to get it together----

`"----"@
` So I just can't pretend I didn't see it.@
` This incident isn't over yet.@
` It seems once I got involved in this incident, I have to see this out to the very end--\

` Her room is still the same, but Arcueid isn't there.@
` …… Well, I didn't think I'd find her this easy.@ Looks like I have to go out into the city and look for her.\

` The sun sinks and the city is really starting to get dark.@
` I looked around the major places in the city, but I didn't even catch a glimpse of her.\

`"----Damn it.@ She was around when it didn't matter, so why can't I find her when I do need her?"@
` …… What should I do?@
