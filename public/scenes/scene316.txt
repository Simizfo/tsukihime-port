` The door opens with a creak.@
` With a heavy body and dulled mind, I make it back to the mansion.@
` My footsteps drag behind me.@
` The moonlight illuminates my figure, making it look like an exhausted ghost.\

`"-----------"@
` …… My left arm hurts where Yumizuka wounded me.@
` The bleeding has stopped, and the gradual lessening of the pain tells me it couldn't have been too deep.\
`"-----------"@
` I reach the stairs.@
` I don't even care about treating my wounds.@
` Right now, I just want to stumble back to my room and sleep like a rock----\
br
`"Eh………?@ Nii--san…………?"@
br
` --And then.@
` From the middle of the stairs, I hear Akiha's voice.\

`"……………… Akiha?"@
` I raise my head.@
` In front of me---I see Akiha who has just now made it to the bottom of the stairway.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t23b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Ah…………"@
` …… Akiha is silent.@
` Something about her appearance is a little strange, but I don't even care right now and continue stumbling up the steps.@
` Right now I should just go to my room.@
` So I have to keep going up the stairs.@
` I dazedly make my way past Akiha's still figure.@ I have to get up the stairs---\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t17b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"H…… Hey, please wait, Nii-san!@ Just where did you go this late in the evening?"@
`"-------"@
` Who knows?@ Besides, what is Akiha doing standing here at this hour anyway?@
` Trying to glide down the stairs as quietly as possible, it seems like she was going to go outside just now.\

`"…… It doesn't have anything to do with you, Akiha.@ I'm going to my room, so don't bother me."@
`"Bother, I---"@
` Akiha gasps and cuts off mid-sentence.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san, you look---"@
` Her previously shocked eyes become calm.\

`"Your left arm is injured, right?@ Your clothes are pretty dirty too."@
`"…… Don't worry about it.@ It doesn't even hurt anymore."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"It doesn't hurt?@ That can't be true.@ You look like you could collapse at any moment, and there's blood clotted all over your left arm.@ Goodness, just what in the world were you doing, Nii-san?"@
`"……………"@
` I can't answer, and only avert my gaze.@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` I couldn't possibly explain everything that happened tonight, and more than that---I don't ever want to talk about Yumizuka to anyone.\

`"…… Nothing much.@ I was just walking around and got sucked into a little drunken brawling."@
` Answering simply, I climb past her.@
` But with a pull,
` Akiha places her hands on my shoulders.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Nii-san, I'll get mad."@
` With a weak voice, Akiha looks directly at me.@
`"……………"@
` With her face like that, I become even more unable to tell her what really happened.\

`"-----"@
`"……………"@
` Just like that, time passes without either of us speaking.@
` …… After some minutes pass, Akiha lets out a breath and drops her shoulders in resignation.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Fine.@ I will let it go."@
` Akiha grabs my uninjured right arm and heads towards the sitting room.\

`"…… Hey, Akiha.@ I wanna go back to my room and sleep."@
`"No.@ I won't ask you any more about it, so you have to let me treat your injuries, okay?@ So come this way.@ I can't help but be worried if you go to sleep looking like that."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Still holding on to my arm, she drags me with her to the lobby.@
`"…………………"@
` Oh well.@ This is just how it is.@
` I resign myself to doing as Akiha says.\

` ---The treatment was quite simple.@
br
` I guess it was really not that bad to begin with.@ After applying some disinfectant and wrapping the wound in gauze, my treatment is over.@
` After finishing that simple care by herself, Akiha takes a towel soaked in warm water and wipes my face.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"All finished.@ This uniform is done for, so we will have to get a new one prepared tomorrow."@
`"………………"@
` …… My mind is still numb.@
` Akiha really hasn't asked me any questions about what happened and simply took care of my injury.@
` I'm a little surprised.@ I thought she would let Kohaku-san or Hisui take care of it, but Akiha did it all with a smile.@
` …… Her gentleness is completely different from the way she was these past three days and I think back about Akiha from long ago.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san?@ Hey, it's all finished, so please go back to your room.@ Didn't you say you would rather go to sleep than keep me company?"@
` She may still be resenting my words from earlier because she sounds very dissatisfied.@
`"……………"@
` There's still something wrong with my brain, but I do understand how much Akiha worried over me.@
`"…… Yeah.@ Thanks, Akiha."@
` Is it because I'm still woozy?@ I let my true feelings show.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t24.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Eh--"@
` Akiha's face turns red and she shrinks away from me.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t16b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----Oh?@ I, I don't think it was anything to thank me for.@ You would help me if I was hurt, right Nii-san?"@
`"That may be true, but it makes me happy."@
` Stuttering, I finally realize it.@
` I am quite emotionally detached right now, but I honestly am happy that---rather than Kohaku-san or Hisui, Akiha was the one that treated my wounds.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t24.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"D---don't say such stupid things, please hurry back to your room.@ Or are you hurt somewhere else?"@
` Akiha says so and shifts her gaze.@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

`"----?@ Nii-san, your shoulder… there's blood."\


` Akiha places her hand on my shoulder.@
` She peels back my shirt.@
` My exposed shoulder, and neck.@
` Yumizuka's bite marks and dried blood are still there.\

`"Nii-san, this--------"@
` In that instant,
` the air freezes.\

`"………………"@
` The fang shaped wounds on my neck.@
` I don't know how to even begin to explain that and descend into silence.@
`"-------"@
` Akiha slowly leans her body towards mine.@
`"…… Nii-san…… there is still…… blood flowing, here."@
` Her voice is terribly taut with strain.@
` The grip of her hand on my shoulder becomes stronger.@
` Her body stops in a position somewhere between touching mine and not.\

`"…… What should I do…… We should, stop the bleeding, right----"@
` Her voice sounds delirious.@
`"----Akiha?"@
` I call her name while assailed by an unspeakable disquiet.@
`"Nnn------"@
` There's no reply.@
` But instead,
` I feel a warm sensation along my neck.\

`"Wha…………………"@
` My voice fades away.@
` Akiha's face is right next to mine.@
br
` …… The sensation of rubbing.@
` …… A contact.@ Wetness.@
br
`"Aki………… ha…… ?"@
` …… My numbed sense of reason can't grasp what's going on.@

` A hesitatingly touching tongue.@
` The red tongue that fearfully touches my neck.@
` Shaking.@ The shaking fingers that embrace me, the warmth of Akiha's body.\

`"Aaaa--------,"@
` …… Akiha is licking the blood dribbling down my neck.@
` But, it really isn't anything to be alarmed over.@
` It's just like what you would do as a kid to stop the bleeding.@
` But it feels so sweet, I can't say anything.@
` Akiha must think the same way, as she just---for no reason, brushes her teeth against my wound.\

!w3000

` ----All of a sudden.@
br
br
br
br
br
` A sound comes from the lobby.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t24.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"------!"@
` Akiha pulls back.@
`"I----I'm so sorry, Nii-san----!"@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Her face a pure red, Akiha runs away.\

`"Wha------"@
` Left by myself in the sitting room, I reach my hand up to my neck.@
` Her warmth is still lingering there faintly.@
`"…… She didn't have to run away."@
` I murmur to myself and shake my head.@
` Licking the wound like that, I did a lot of that as a child.@ I did that to Akiha and Kohaku-san when they got hurt.@
` …… But, that's just an act from child-like purity, only done as a child.@
` Both of us grown up like this now and being the opposite gender.@ We can't really use that method anymore.\

`"…… What was she doing?@ …… She was acting pretty strange."@
` …… Well, I guess I'm also strange right now.@
` As if in a dream, I can't recall what exactly happened.@
` Even what Akiha and I just did, I feel like it'll all be a dream tomorrow morning.\

` …… And I reach my room.@
` I lurch to my bed and collapse.@
`"------Nnn."@
` Tiredness closes in around my brain.@
` My exhaustion is more in my body than my mind.@
` My body must be trying to halt everything in order to quickly heal its exertions.@
` Before that, I take a deep breath and trace my fingers along my neck once more.\

`"…………… Ah."@
` I'm a little surprised.@
` The two fang marks.@ The blood really was stopped by Akiha's lips----\

` I wake from a long sleep.@
` The sunshine from the window looks closer to mid-day than morning.@
` It must be because of how late I got back last night.@
` It seems I've overslept.\

`"……………"@
` Dragging myself up from bed, I look down at my hand.@
` ----The sensation of how I stabbed Yumizuka remains.@
` Two nights ago.@
` When I met Yumizuka and saw that hideous dream.@
`"…… If only yesterday…… was just a dream."@
` But wishing it won't make it so.@
` I've no clue why or how Yumizuka became a vampire, and I couldn't do anything to help her.\

` ---No.@
` Once Yumizuka had become like that, there was probably no way for anyone to help her.@
` She was already dead.@
` All I did was return that corpse somehow moving about as if it were a living thing back to being a dead body.@ That's the only way I can think of it.@

`"Please excuse me, Shiki-sama."@
` With that voice I have become accustomed to, Hisui enters the room.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama.@ How are you feeling today?"@
`"Hm…… ah, I slept well, so I don't feel bad at all."@
`"Is that so?@ Hearing that makes me feel very relieved."@
` …… Even though she says that, I don't see her even relax her shoulders, or give any other indication of it.\

`"……………"@
` But, I feel relieved as well.@
` Because of what happened last night, the long night is over.@ Because I don't have to enter that unnatural world any longer, my heart can relax.@
`"…… Thanks, Hisui.@ You've always come to check up on me from early in the morning, right?@ Your concern means a lot to me."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----Not at all.@ It is my duty to be concerned with your welfare."@
` There is a hint of happiness in Hisui's expression.\

` …… Moreover, I feel like I've been somewhat rescued.@
` While I've been sleeping in bed like this, Hisui came as always to wake me up.@
` With just that trivial thing, I honestly feel like I have returned to my normal life.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Um…… Shiki-sama, this is somewhat difficult for me to say, but… can I?"@
`"……?@ Difficult to say?@ If it's about me sleeping in till noon, I really can't do anything but apologize."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, that is not what I meant, but it is perhaps related to when you went to sleep."@
` Hisui fidgets with her fingers as she struggles to come up with the right words.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Um, I did not say anything, but Akiha-sama found out about last night."@
`"Eh…… about last night…… what?"@
`"I mean when you left late last night, Shiki-sama."@
`"----"@
` I unconsciously turn my eyes away from her.@
` I thought I'd managed to slip away undetected, but I should have known Hisui would still find out.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki-sama, your return late at night has gained the attention of Akiha-sama, so I believe you will be asked to explain yourself sooner or later.@
` She is in the sitting room and may be angry, so please be prepared."@
`"……… I see.@ I got it; I'll be prepared."@
` …… But, if it's about last night, then Akiha definitely knows about it already.@
` …… And after that, it was Akiha who took care of me when I was in a complete stupor.\

`"About that, will it be occurring again?@ I cannot stop you, but if you continue doing such things, I must tell Akiha-sama."@
`"----No, nothing like last night will happen again.@ Everything…… has ended last night…… There won't be any phone calls anymore."\

` ---Yes.@ It really has ended.@
` With these words, it truly is over.@
` Yumizuka Satsuki is no more.@
` The vampire skulking the streets has vanished.@ I, with my own hands, sent away a classmate who said she liked me, for all eternity.\
