` -----I know Yumizuka was smiling yesterday.@

` I didn't think that she could make such a face, say "bye bye", and then run away from home.\

`"---Sensei."@
`"What is it, Tohno?@ A question?"@

` He frowns, then, with a difficult expression, bows his head in assent.\

`"Yes, that is what we've heard from Yumizuka Satsuki's parents.@ Yumizuka didn't come home last night, but they've been searching, and I'm sure they've already found her."@
` Saying so, he departs.@
br

` I have a bad feeling about this.@
` …… It's really heavy.@ A terrible feeling as if my body is tied down to this chair.\
