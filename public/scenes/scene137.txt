` It's quiet at the mansion gate.@
` The time is seven o'clock at night.@
` Akiha should be back, probably having tea in the sitting room.\

` ……?@
` I'm not sure what's going on, but I hear voices coming from the sitting room.@ It's almost time for dinner, so it's strange for people to be just talking at this time.@
` Kohaku-san should be in the kitchen, and I think a conversation between Hisui and Akiha would be out of character.@
br
`"…… Kohaku-san and Akiha are drinking tea, perhaps." Well, I guess that's most likely.@
` First thing's first.@ I open the mansion's front door.\

` Hisui is standing in the lobby.@
`"I'm a little late, but I'm back."@
`"………………"@
` Hisui silently greets me devoid of any expression.@
` She does not say her usual "Welcome back", and looks like she's in a bad mood.\

`"Did something happen?@ I might be imagining it, but you seem a little angry."@

`"…… There is a guest for you, Shiki-sama.@ She has been waiting in the sitting room, so please hurry there."@
`"A guest for me?"@
` Hisui nods.\

`"I wonder who.@ There isn't anyone who would come visit me----"@
br
` Oh, wait.@
` I have this terrible, terrible feeling.@
br
`"Hisui.@ What, kind of person is it……?"@
`"A pretty woman with golden hair."@
` Hisui's response is straightforward.@
` I wordlessly dash towards the sitting room.\

` ----Too late.@
` It seems the current state of affairs is already at a level I can't escape from.\

`"----Welcome home, Nii-san."@
`"Oh, you're finally back."@

` They both greet me in completely opposite manners.@
`"………………"@
` What, is this?@
` Arcueid and Akiha seem to be confronting each other.\

` They are both sitting down calmly.@
` But while Arcueid's calmness is natural, Akiha's calmness is from her hostility toward Arcueid.@
` Akiha takes a look at me.\


`"What is the matter, Nii-san?@ You do not have to stand there, please have a seat here."@
br
` Uh, I feel like I'll get stabbed if I go over there.@
br
`"Uh, I'm fine.@ Anyway, Akiha, this person is, well----"@
` Hmm----how should I explain this?@
` Akiha would not believe me if I say she's a classmate of mine, and telling her I met her in town would be like throwing oil on a fire.\

`"Well?@ What is it?"@
`"Um, that's, uh----"@
br
` Now that we're in this situation, I think it doesn't matter what I say, but I have to make a good excuse and get out of it.@
` That's what I have to do, but----why did Arcueid come here in the first place?@
br
`"Um----did she say why she came here?"@

` I point to Arcueid in a desperate suicide gamble.\


`"Hm?"@
` She tilts her head, confused.@

`"…… Isn't she one of your friends, Nii-san?@ That is what she told me."@
`"Well---yeah, you can say she's a friend."@

`"I see.@ I really would like for her to be introduced to me.@ If she is your friend, Nii-san, I can't push her out of our house."@
`"Ah---well, Akiha-san."@
` I start to stammer again.@
` Then Arcueid, unable to sit quietly during our sibling conversation, joins in without my permission.\


`"Please don't worry about it.@ I just came here to get Shiki, so we'll be on our way.@ Isn't that right, Shiki?"@
` …… My whole world jolts.@
br
` ------This is bad.@
` If I let her keep talking, she'll lead me to an early grave.\

`"Huhu, ahahahaha!"@
` Laughing desperately, I run to Arcueid and grab her arm.@

`"Are you leaving, Shiki-sama?"@
`"----Yeah, I'll be back late.@ I really am sorry, but can you leave the gate open?"@
`"----Yes, as you wish."@
