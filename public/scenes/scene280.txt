`"…… Oh well.@ We're finally friends again, and if I talk to her about Arcueid, she'll probably get angry once more."@
` For now, I have to maintain this relationship.@ I watch Senpai as she leaves and then dig into my meal.\

`"----Well then."@
` I should wait here a bit and see what happens.@
` Senpai might come here, and even if she doesn't, I can go to the tea ceremony room.\

` ---Well, meeting Senpai means there are a lot of things we have to talk about.@
` About the vampire in this town, and about Arcueid.@
` Even though I know it will be painful to talk about them, I still get excited at the chance to be with Senpai again.\

` …… *pant*…… *pant*.@

br
` My heated body doesn't cool off that easily.@
` I painfully gasp for air.@
` My body is drenched in sweat, and I feel terrible.\

` My panting fills the air.@
br
` There's---something weird.@
` I've been resting for a while, but my breathing is getting worse.@
` In the first place, why is my body tired after only running this little distance……?\
