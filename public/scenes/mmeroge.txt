`"Huh?@ Weren't you with Akiha?"@
`"Lady Akiha goes to school by car.@ Since I had something to give you this morning, I stayed behind."@
`"Something to give me?"@
`"Yes.@ This came from the Arima family yesterday."@
` Kohaku-san smiles.\

`"Eh?@ But, I have all my luggage already.@ The things I used while I was at the Arimas' house all belonged to them, so all I've got are my own clothes…"@
`"Really?@ But this was sent here, nonetheless…"@
` Kohaku-san hands me a small wooden box.@
` It's not heavy at all.\

`"…… Kohaku-san, I've never seen this before."@
`"Well… apparently it was left to you by your departed father.@ It was to be given to you in the will."@
`"…… By my old man?"@
` …… I can't feel anything about that.@
` What's the old man who expelled me from this mansion eight years ago doing leaving me things?\

`"Oh well.@ Kohaku-san, please take it to my room for me."@

`"------"@
` Kohaku-san is staring intently at the wooden box.@
` She seems almost like a child who wants a toy.@
br
` Staaaaare.@
br
` No, she is a child.\

`"…… I get it.@ You want to know what's inside, right?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Oh, not at all.@ I merely wondered for a moment."@
` …… Like I said, you do wonder what's inside.@
`"Alright, let's open it.@ One, two… three!"@
` With a dry sound, the wooden box opens.@
` Inside, there is----a computer game.\

`"…… It's… a computer game."@
` With bright and gaudy packaging, it has finger marks all over it.@
` …… The old man must have really hated me to leave me a piece of junk like this.\

`"No, Shiki-san.@ It's an eroge!"@
` Kohaku-san takes the case out of the box.@
`"See, isn't it one of those dating games?@ One, two… three!"@
` With a "pachink!", she opens up the case.@
` …… I see, it certainly is an eroge.@ Wait, an eroge!?\

`"It's old, but it seems pretty fun.@ I guess it takes place during the year and era written on the back."@
` Kohaku-san closes the case and hands it over.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` Certainly, there's a number written on the case.@
` The character 'seven', and under it, the character 'night'.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_nowaitdisp
`"Nee-san, there is no era by that name.@ It just says 'Nanatsu-yoru'."@
`"!"@
` Surprised, I turn around.@
` Hisui, who had been silent until now, was looking at the game over my shoulder.\

`"Y, you surprised me… Hisui, you should say something.@ You don't have to look over my shoulder like that, you know.@ If you want to see it, I'll show it to you."@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Ah---"@
br
` Hisui's cheeks suddenly become a little redder.\

`"P-please excuse me.@ Uh---That game looked so beautiful that I could not help myself."@
`"Beautiful?@ You really think it's beautiful?@ It looks kind of beat up to me."@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"---Not at all.@ The cover art is masterful.@ I think it is an eroge with its own proper storyline."@
`"Really?@ It looks to me like a piece of junk…"\

` But since Hisui seems so convinced, I begin to feel the same thing.@
` …… Hmmm.@ In its own way, I guess it's not such a bad inheritance.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02.jpg",%type_nowaitdisp
`"'Seven nights'…?@ Maybe that's the name of this eroge?"@
`"Maybe…@ I think I can imagine what would be happening during those seven nights."@
` I skim the back of the case.@ Apparently, it's about a lot of imouto and some guy named "TakaJun".@
` At any rate, it's obvious that it's an antique.@
`"Well, I believe in taking what's given to me…"\
