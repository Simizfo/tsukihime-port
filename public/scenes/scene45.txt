` …… Let's see… Kohaku-san's room is… here, isn't it?@
br
` Knock knock.@ I knock on her door.@
`"Kohaku-san, are you there?"@
`"Yes, please hold on for a minute."@
` I can hear her cheerful voice from inside the room.@
br
` I wait for about three minutes.@
` Kohaku-san opens the door and pokes her head out.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Oh, it's you, Shiki-sama.@ What are you doing here at this time?"@
`"Uh… well---I was wondering if you'd let me watch your TV…"@
`"Eh?"@
` Kohaku-san gives me a bewildered look.\

`"Ah… well, there's no TV in this house, is there?@ I've been living in a normal house up until now, so it's become a daily routine for me to watch TV after dinner.@ I guess I can't calm down without watching it or something like that, so…"@
` …… The more I say it, the more I realize I'm doing something stupid.\

` There is something not right about barging into a lady's room demanding to watch her TV.@
br
` Look, even Kohaku-san is just standing there, looking bewilder---wait, no she's not.@
br
`"Ahaha, I guess you're right.@ You've been living at the Arima household up until yesterday, after all.@ You must think this mansion to be kind of depressing after moving here all of a sudden."@
` Kohaku-san gives a cheerful laugh.\

`"Eh, let's see… Have you talked to Akiha-sama and Hisui-chan about this yet?"@
`"You mean about coming to your room, Kohaku-san?"@
` Kohaku-san nods.@
`"No, I haven't talked to anyone about it yet.@ What about it?"\

`"No, no, it's nothing.@ It's just that I would have to turn you away if you had already talked to them about it."@
` Smiling while she speaks, Kohaku-san looks up and down the hallway.@
`"Luckily for us, there isn't anyone else around.@ Please hurry up and come in.@ It'll be troublesome if we're caught."\

`"Please, just sit anywhere.@ I'll go make some tea."@
`"……"@
` Coughing to clear my throat, I take a seat.\

` There are all sorts of little things in Kohaku-san's room.@
` It might be thought of as a bit messy for a girl's room.@ There aren't really many things you could call cute, and what she does have is a lot of things that don't look very useful.@
` …… Rather, it has an atmosphere of a room belonging to an orderly, scholarly person.\

` Buried in the miscellaneous objects, I find the TV.@
` On top of the table is the remote… maybe Kohaku-san has been watching the TV until just now.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02b.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Thanks for waiting.@ Tea is fine for you, isn't it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Ah, thank you.@ Please don't mind me too much."@
`"Oh no, not at all.@ I'm sorry I can't do much to treat you."@
` Kohaku-san says so, smiling warmly.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"So, the TV.@ What do you watch at around this time, Shiki-sama?"@
`"I don't have any set programs in particular, but the news is a pretty basic one.@ I like to hear new trends, and I like snob stories."@
`"Is that so?@ You seem like a very laid-back person, so I thought you'd be reading after dinner or something."@
`"Ahaha, no, I don't have such refined interests.@ I don't consider myself laid-back either, but maybe that's the impression I give with my glasses."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---Ah!@ You wear glasses, Shiki-sama.@ Akiha-sama didn't say anything about that at all, so I was quite surprised when I saw you at the door."@
` …… I see.@ I haven't met Akiha since I started wearing these glasses.@
`"These glasses are just for show.@ I guess you could say my eyes are bad, but I think my vision is better than that of most people.@ It's not because I studied too much and went near-sighted or anything… Ah, crap.@ I had an intellectual image, but did I disappoint you?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t15.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Not at all.@ I enjoy watching TV more than reading, too.@ I'm glad that you're an energetic person, just like I thought you were."@
`"Ah… yeah, thanks."@
` I'm a little embarrassed.@
` Faced directly with Kohaku-san's carefree smile, I can't help but feel a little nervous.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, I'm sorry.@ You came to watch the news, didn't you?"@
` Kohaku-san switches the TV on.@
` It's already nine o'clock.@
` The news, as it usually does, reports the day's events with a little exaggeration.\

`"Oh dear.@ Looks like there's been another one of those serial murders."@
` Kohaku-san says to herself while sitting next to me, sounding not the least bit concerned.@
br
` The news is running a special feature on the serial killings.@
` The serial murders, which began in the neighboring town, are now beginning to be concentrated within this town.\

` It's a pretty simple story.@
` Late at night, he attacks young girls indiscriminately, and in the end, he drains their blood.@
` It seems like last night's victim is the ninth one so far.\

`"I wonder what the police are doing about it?"@
`"Who knows?@ It would seem pretty easy to catch a murderer who comes out at night, but maybe he's really careful so they can't trace him."\

`"You could be right.@ The clues about murderers build up as they kill more people, so if they haven't caught him even after nine murders, he must be really carefully prepared for the killings."@
`"A careful killer, huh?@ But aren't these killings spontaneous crimes?@ It's quite strange to think of them as being carefully prepared."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"You're right.@ If there's no evidence left at all, then maybe he's not a random killer at all.@ I can only think that he's got it all planned out from the start for execution."@
`"Ah, I see.@ But then what would be the point of killing those nine girls?@ Are they friends of his?@ Acquaintances?"\

`"Hmm… probably not.@ If there were connections like that, then I think the police would have realized it by now.@ In the end, I suppose it's an incomprehensible case without motive or connections."@
` …… Kohaku-san says all of this disturbing stuff with a smile.@
br
` It seems like she's not really worried about this case.\

`"These murders are happening right here in this town, Kohaku-san.@ You're a young girl and all, so aren't you even a little scared?"@
`"I'll be fine, since the killer only appears late at night.@ If I don't go out at night, I won't run into him."@
` Kohaku-san really is a clear thinker.@
` …… It is perhaps a bit of a raw explanation, but I suppose that's how a mere news story should be treated.\

`"Sure, I'll be waiting."@
` Kohaku-san looks up and down the hallway.\

`"……"@
` …… I had no idea bedtime at the mansion was at ten.@
` Apparently, there's some kind of unwritten rule here that one is not to be out of their room after ten.\

`"It's still so formal here, even with the old man gone."@
` Well, I guess it's only natural.@
` I'm also getting tired from my unfamiliarity with this mansion, so I obediently return to my room.\

`"Are you there, Shiki-sama?"@
` I can hear Hisui's voice along with a knock at the door.@
`"Yeah, I'm here.@ Come in."@

`"Good evening.@ Thanks for making my bed, Hisui."@
` Hisui quietly nods in acceptance.@
`"…… Urgh."@
` Just as I thought, I'm not used to this.@
`"…… Uh… is there anything else you want to tell me?"@
`"No, nothing from me, but Akiha-sama has instructed me to answer any questions you may have."\

`"…… I see.@ There are many things I want to ask, but I'll probably get to know them as I continue to live here……"@
` Yeah.@ What I want to know right now before I sleep is---
`"Is it true that the curfew here is seven?"@
`"Yes.@ The main gate is locked at seven, and all the entrances to the mansion are to be locked at eight.@
` It is also a rule that one must try not to go walking around in the mansion after ten."\

`"Not even walking around in the mansion?@ …… Well, I've got no complaint with that, but isn't that kind of harsh?@ Akiha and I aren't children, so I don't think you have to go that far."@
`"…… Indeed.@ It is a rule, however, so please abide by it.@ You are aware of the recent disturbances at night, are you not, Shiki-sama?"@
br
` …… Yeah, that vampire thing Arihiko was talking about.@
` Well, as long as something like that is happening, I guess it's better to be safe than sorry.\

`"What else… Oh, do you mind if I ask an off-topic question?"@
`"Yes, what is it?"@
`"I'd like to know what kind of work you and Kohaku-san do around here."@
`"I am here to serve Shiki-sama's needs, and my sister Kohaku to serve Lady Akiha-sama.@
` In our spare time, we do the maintenance chores around the mansion.@ Is there anything more you would like to know?"@
`"…… To serve… So that's what it is after all."\

` My shoulders suddenly feel heavier.@
` It seemed completely natural to Akiha when she said it, but I'm nothing more than a normal high school student.@
` I have no interest in having a girl around my age serving me, at least not for now.\

`"…… By serving me, you mean you're a personal servant?"@
`"Yes.@ Please do not hesitate to ask anything of me."@
`"…… Well, I get it.@ Going by how Akiha was talking about you, it doesn't seem like I can dismiss you, so I'll just obediently let you serve me…"@
`"Is there anything in particular you would like?"@
`"Nothing in particular, but could you stop calling me 'Shiki-sama'?@ To be honest, I get chills down my back when I hear it."\

`"But Shiki-sama, you are my master."@
`"That's what I'm saying I hate.@ I've been living a normal life up until yesterday.@ I have no desire to start living a life where a girl my age addresses me with '-sama'."@
`"I see." Hisui's response was less than enthusiastic.\

`"Just call me Shiki, and in exchange, I'll call you Hisui.@ Let's do away with the formalities and be more casual with each other."@
` Still expressionless, Hisui lowers her eyebrows as if she's being troubled.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"But, you are my employer."@
`"It's not like I'm hiring you.@ You're the one doing the things I can't, so you're the great one."@
`"I see." Hisui gives another unenthusiastic reply.@
` …… It looks like I won't be able to talk her into it in just one day.\

`"---Anyhow, that's how it is.@ Don't be so formal towards me.@ I'll be grateful if you'd tell that to your sister Kohaku-san, too."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Very well, as you say, Shiki-sama."@
` Expressionless, Hisui bows her head.@
br
` She completely failed to understand.@
br
`"I will be leaving now.@ Please rest now for tonight."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid
` Bowing, Hisui puts her hand on the doorknob.\

br
` ---Oh, I forgot to ask something.@

`"Ah, hold on for a second."@

`"Eh---?"@
` It's so sudden, that's the only thing I can say.@
` Hisui is expressionless, but she glares at me fiercely.\

` I feel like I just did something really terrible.\

`"Ah… Yeah, I'm sorry."@
` I apologize without thinking.@
` I don't understand why myself.@ I just feel sorry for Hisui and I lower my head.@

`"No, well, maybe, but I just…"@

` I scratch my head.@
` Hisui stares at me, pausing only to blink for a second.@
`"Um… What was it you wanted to ask me, Shiki-sama?"@
` That's right.@
` I stopped her because I wanted to ask her something.\

`"Oh, I wanted to ask about Akiha.@ Doesn't she go to a boarding school?"@
`"That was only during middle school, Shiki-sama.@ From this year onwards, Akiha-sama has special permission to attend school from home."@
`"Eh… You mean she goes to school from here?"@
`"Yes, but it is uncommon for her to come home before dusk like today.@ Akiha-sama has practice up until dinner, so she is always home before seven.\

`"Practice?---Practice what?"@
`"Today is Thursday, so she would have had violin practice."@
`"----Eh?"@
`"Usually, she is able to return before dinner on weekdays, so if you have anything to say to Akiha-sama, please let Nee-san know after dinner."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_fst
` Hisui bows to say goodbye, and leaves the room.\


`"Violin practice…"@
` What on earth is that?@
` She's not some upper-class lady or anything, so why should she have to do something as bothersome as---
br
`"…… Oh wait, she is an upper-class lady."@
br
` Yes.@ Come to think of it, my sister, Tohno Akiha, is a natural born upper-class lady.\

` In my memories, she was always the obedient, ever-uneasy sister who'd always follow me around.@ As a child, Akiha was always quiet, never having even the courage to express her own desires.@ She was a frail girl who would always live in fear of a scolding from our father.@
`"---Yeah, people really do change after eight years."@
br
` After eight years, I've become the me I am now.@
` Akiha has become the Akiha of right now, too.\

` ---Eight years is a long time.@
` It's half of our lives up until now.@
` I was absent from this mansion during that vital period where a child becomes an adult.@
br
`"…… I'm sorry, Akiha."@
` I think things would have been better if I had been with her during those eight years.@
` I unconsciously mumble an apology.\
