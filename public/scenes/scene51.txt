` Sensei told me.@
` My eyes could see the points where things could easily be broken.@
` And if that 'thing' were to be a person, then what I would see would be their vital spots.\
` Lines which, if cut, could break something apart without any effort.@
` With those lines, even things as hard as steel could easily be cut.@
br
`"In other words, everything in existence has its destiny of 'breaking' internalized within it.@ This is something inescapable for anything with a physical form, Shiki."\
` That's what Sensei had said.@
` I was still a child back then.@
` I remember finally understanding what she meant and getting scared.@
` In other words, the world is full of cracks, and it could collapse at any instant.@

` If there are scribbles all over the ground, then there's a possibility that the earth would start breaking apart if I walk over it.@
` ---When I realized what she meant, I thanked Sensei from the bottom of my heart for the glasses she gave me.\
br
` I couldn't have gone on living if I had continued to see the lines all the time.@
` The points where things could easily be broken.@
` There isn't a single advantage to being able to see them---\

`"---Good morning."@
br
` …… I hear an unfamiliar voice.\
`"It is morning.@ It is time for you to awaken, Shiki-sama."@
` …… Stop calling me Shiki-sama already.@
` I told you yesterday, it sends chills down my back----\

` ---I wake up.@
` Hisui stands far from the bed, like a statue.@
`"……"@
br
` Where am I?@
br
`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."@
` The girl in a maid uniform bows.\
`"Ah… yeah, I came home, right…"@
` I push myself up, looking around the room.@

` In that instant---
br
` ---I feel sharp pain in my temples.\
`"Huh---?"@
`"Are you looking for your glasses?"@
` Hisui gently hands me my glasses.@

`"---Phew."@
br
` …… I let out a breath.@
` Last night---Before I went to sleep, I had the feeling I was seeing the lines even with my glasses on.@ Seems like it was just my imagination.\
`"Sstt……"@
` Maybe it's because I slept in an unfamiliar room, but my mind is hazy.@

`"Shiki-sama…?"@
` Hisui calls out to me.@
` Shaking my head, I shake away my sleepiness.\
`"Good morning, Hisui.@ Thanks for coming to wake me."@
`"There is no need to thank me.@ It is my duty to come and wake you, Shiki-sama."@
` Hisui gives a plain and completely expressionless response.\
` …… Even in an unfavorable light, I think Hisui's features are beautiful.@
` It should be wonderful for such a girl to wake me every morning, but as Hisui never smiles, I don't feel that happy about it.@
br
` …… What a shame.@
` If Hisui only had half of Kohaku's brightness, she would be really cute.\

`"---Do you need something?"@
` Realizing I am looking at her, Hisui stares straight back at me.@
`"No, nothing at all.@ Waking up with you there makes me feel like I'm really at the Tohno mansion."@
` Now then.@ Getting off the bed, I stretch out both arms.@
br
` Suddenly, I realize I'm wearing pajamas.\
` ---Eh, I'm sure that yesterday, I…\
`"Huh?@ I thought I slept in my uniform last night."@
`"Yes.@ Since it is bad for your health to do so, Nee-san changed your clothes and put you to bed afterwards."@
` Hisui explains it as if it is something perfectly natural.@
` I see.@ She changed my clothes.@ It's true that I could have caught a cold if I had just slept like that.@
` Just the kind of attentive service you'd expect from a maid---Hey, wait a minute…!\

`"Wh------!?"@
` I quickly check my pants and underwear.@
` My pants are brand new pajama pants.@ Even my underwear is new.\
`"Wh-wh-wh-!?"@
` I want to say 'What the hell did you do!?', but somehow the words are stuck in my throat.@
` I've got to calm down and think things over for now.@
` …… Let's see.@ First of all, half the blame belongs to me.@
` And the one who changed me wasn't Hisui, it was her sister, Kohaku-san.@
` It would be wrong to complain to Hisui.\
`"---Hisui."@
`"Yes, what is it?"@
`"You don't have to do anything uncalled for like this from now on.@ If you have to, please wake me up.@ I can change myself, so I'd like to do so."@
` My face is a deep red as I say all of this.@ Hisui obediently nods in affirmation.@
`"Your uniform is folded and awaits you over there.@ Please come to the sitting room after you have changed."\

`"………"@
` Damn it.@ How careless could I be.@
` It was careless of me to begin with when I fell asleep on the bed like that, but to not have woken up while I was being changed is over the top.@
`"Usually I would have sensed it, but… maybe I was just really tired."@
` Complaining to myself isn't going to change anything.@ I can't just keep standing here talking to myself like an idiot.@ I'd better hurry up and change, then go have breakfast.\

` My school uniform is neatly folded, and my shirt is even ironed.@
` Passing my wrists through the sleeves feels good.@ It's that fresh, brand-new feeling.\

`"…… No, there's nothing wrong with being naked, is there?@ Yep."@
` There was nothing wrong with it, but I couldn't help being embarrassed at the fact that I was being changed by the warmly smiling Kohaku-san.@
` To top things off, the face in the mirror keeps smiling from time to time despite being bright red.@
` …… Are you really okay, Tohno Shiki?@
` I thought you were supposed to be uneasy about staying here, you amateur.\
