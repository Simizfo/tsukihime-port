` For the time being, we go into town.@
` All that's left is to branch off the main street and go to the empty alley----\

` Arcueid perplexedly cocks her head to the side.@
` …… It seems like she doesn't notice at all.\

` I can feel the weight of stares all around me.@
` Just walking down the street causes people all around to cast glances at us.@
` …… It doesn't need to be said, but it's probably because Arcueid really stands out.\

` I'm a little aware of it, but everyone else's reactions make me even more conscious of it, and it's a bit troubling.@
` Arcueid acts just like she normally does, but since I can't help but be overwhelmed by her femininity, I can't seem to make any meaningful conversation.\

`"Hey, do you hear me Shiki?@ I'm asking you where we're going."@
`"We're almost there so hold on.@ We're going somewhere you can relax."\

` Huh----?@
` Her gaze suddenly turns heartless, almost deadly.\

`"Arcueid……?@ Don't tell me, you're not happy with this place……?"@
`"……………………"@
` …… She seems so angry she can't even speak.\

`"That's odd…… You're a vampire, so I thought you would like a place like this better than somewhere crowded----"@

`"Hey, Shiki.@ What kind of a joke is this?"@
`"Ah----uh."@
` Frightening.@ Her smiling face is really frightening.\

`"No, um…… I'm really sorry.@ I really messed up."@
` I bring my hands together and implore forgiveness.@
` She keeps smiling.\

` When we first met!?@ That means----
br
`"Yeah, the results may turn out a little different from back then, but that might be fun too, right Shiki?"\

` ----This is a threat.@

`"…… I said I'm sorry.@ I'll make it up to you, so please stop smiling like that.@ I'll take you somewhere better."@

`"Really?@ I was getting in the mood for it too."@
` She looks disappointed.\

` …… I really must contemplate my actions.@
` Even though Arcueid is a vampire, I must have been really stupid to take her to an alley for a date……\

` For four hours…
` Appropriate for the ball of curiosity that is Arcueid, we end up going to the department store in front of the station.\

` It seems like Arcueid made me take her there just to trouble me, but somewhere along the way, I guess it started to be pretty fun for her and she became happy again.@ It was a little tiring, but I think it was a good time.\
