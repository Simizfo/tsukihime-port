`"Eh?@ Ah, um… I was just a little surprised at how calm you were about all of this, Tohno-kun."@
`"Really?@ Well, my family is a strict one, so I'm used to these kinds of things.@ More importantly, Senpai, didn't you have something you wanted to talk to me about?"\

`"Yes.@ I haven't thanked you for this morning yet, so I thought I'd take care of you for a bit like this."@
` Senpai makes her incredulous statement with a soft smile.\

`"T-take care of me?@ That's not how you use the phrase 'take care' in Japanese, Senpai."@
`"Oh, really?@ You mean people don't say 'taking care' when they're showing someone hospitality in order to thank them?"@
`"---No, they don't.@ I don't think it's a mistake, exactly, but it's not quite right either."@
`"Hmm.@ These manners-related phrases sure are difficult, aren't they?@ I suppose I shouldn't try to use them if I'm not familiar with them."@
` Senpai laughs embarrassedly.\

`"No, not at all.@ They say manners come from the heart, after all.@ As long as you have the right feelings, it's just a trivial error."@

` Senpai's eyes snap in my direction as she stares at me.@
` …… Her gaze is so serious I feel like I just became some kind of rare animal in a zoo.\

`"Um…… Senpai?@ Did I just say something rude?"@

`"………………"@
` Senpai continues to stare at me.@
`"Um……… Senpai?"@
` For some reason, I feel incredibly embarrassed.@
`"------It really does suit you well, Tohno-kun.@ Being younger yet calmer than me… you're impertinent."@
` Senpai glares at me.@
` …… I don't understand how her mind works at all.\

`"------I'm sorry.@ It was kind of arrogant for me to speak like that."@

`"Yes, it was so impertinent I was moved."@
` She lowers her shoulders with a sigh and she sips her tea.@

`"I've become curious about you, Tohno-kun.@ Please, talk to me.@ It can be about anything."@
` Senpai straightens her posture, with an attitude like a teacher looking at her student.@
`"…………"@
` It doesn't seem like I can refuse.\

`"…… Well, okay, but it's not going to be very interesting if we're just going to talk about me, Senpai."@
` Senpai responds with a smile.@
` …… I've got no choice.@
` It's not like me, but I suppose I'll talk to her about school------\

` In the end, Senpai was happy to listen no matter what I talked to her about.@
` It was surprising to see her get so worked up when we were talking about middle school.@ Apparently, Senpai had never been on a school trip.@
`"That sounds nice, everyone going on a trip together," she said, her eyes twinkling.@ It was quite an impressive sight.@
br
` At any rate, I held a one-sided conversation for an hour, but it made me rather tired.@
` With Senpai's permission, I decide to head home.\
