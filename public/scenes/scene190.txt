` ----I'll check in the alley she was in last night.@
` If she's running away from people, that's the only place I can think of.\

` I still have no control over my breathing.@
` I run with all my strength from the park.@
` My heart screams from overexertion.@
` Ignoring it, I continue to run to find her as soon as possible.\

`"----Arcueid!"@
` As soon as I get to the alley, I call out her name.@
`"You're here, aren't you?@ Come out, Arcueid……!"@
` Under the moonlight, my solitary voice echoes in the alley.@
`"…… Arcueid……!@ Please, come out……!"\

br
br
br
br
br
` …… There's no response.@
` There's only an empty loneliness here.\

`"Damn…………!"@
` Arcueid isn't here.@
` Then where else is there?@
br
` I can't find her running around aimlessly.@
` At this rate I'll never----never see her again.\

`"------"@
` No, I'm not done yet.@
` I still haven't fulfilled my promise with Arcueid.@
br
` The promise to help her defeat the vampire, and the promise to meet tonight so we can fight together.\


`"…… Pro…… mise……"@
` …… That's right.@ There's still our promise.@
` Even if it's just one-sided, I----even if it's just me, I'll fulfill our promise.\

` I return to the park.@
` Our promise still remains here.@
` Our unfulfilled promise for tonight remains here.@
br
` ----So,
` If I can't break this promise, and if she thinks it's important too,
br
` Arcueid will come back here.@
` I can only continue to believe in her and wait here.\
