` Her dagger is poised directly in front of my heart.@
` A situation where I'm a second away from being killed.\

` Her voice, tinged with disgust.@
` Her eyes, rimmed with contempt.@

` Before she can plunge her dagger deeply into me, my knife runs through the 'line' on Senpai's neck.@

`"A--------"@
br
` Which one of us said that?@
` The sound of a head hitting the ground and the sound of gurgling.@ The neck, "neck", / face?@ / it rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls.\

`"Ah------eh?"@

` But, that's strange.\
` It had to have been the same time.@ But only I am alive.@ Senpai's head, HEAD, is the only thing rolling and rolling and rolling.\

`"Haha----a!"@
br
` In other words.@
` From the very beginning,
` Senpai never… intended… to kill me.@
br
`"A, haa, a, haahaahaahaa, haha!"@

` Senpai's body is so red.@
` The hallway gets wet.\
` Red paint coats everything.\

` Spurting.@
` Like a sprinkler, spraying red blood everywhere.@

`"Ha, haha------ha."@

` My whole body is now crimson.@
` More than my knife, from my hair to my shoes, it's sickeningly speckled red.\

`"----What's this?@ This isn't a big deal."@

` Yeah, it really not a big deal.@
` I thought there would be something more, but I only have this floating feeling.@

`"If it's like this… my dreams were more…"@

` I stand up and start walking.@
` My feet splash with each step.@
` Before me lays the head of the woman named Ciel.@ Her eyes seem to stare at me.@

`"How stupid, Senpai.@ I don't know how much confidence you had, but there's nothing that can't die."@

` So, it was your mistake.@
` Mistake.@
` Mistake.@
` Mistake.@

` What's mistaken is everything.\

` The illusion is over.@
` Even though I desperately denied it until now, this confirms it.@
` I am just a killer.@
` With my own hands, I destroyed what shouldn't have been destroyed.@ The foundations of my being are crumbling away.@
br
`"Kk----what's this, Yumizuka?@ It's just like you said."@
br
` I start to laugh.@
` It seems I have gone insane.@
` The truth that I am the killer seems so funny to me.\

` Outside the window, the far, distant moon shines.@
` My vision has turned red with no signs of returning normal.@
` But my mind on earth has been swapped with that from some other planet.@
` The years of accumulated perceptions exceedingly enumerate towards unknown equations of evolution.@
` Nothing is even remotely the same.@ You can not tell the difference between the crimson you see and the crimson I see.@
` Alas.@
` It seems I am broken.@
