` The howling continues.@
` There's no way I can sleep like this.@
` …… I can't sleep, but that's just normal.@
`"……………… I'm sleepy, so I'll pass."@
` Pulling the sheets over me, I stretch out on the bed.@
` I can just think of the howling as the sound of something mundane, like cars driving by on the street.\

` *sigh*@
` Today's been a very long day.@
` I'm mentally tired from eating dinner in this unfamiliar mansion and my conversations with Akiha and everyone else.@ After all that, the howling is just background noise.@
` I close my eyes and gently fall asleep.\

` I think I just heard something.@
` Half-awake, I look at the clock.@ It's just past two.@
` …… It's been about two hours since I heard the dogs howling.@
` The dogs' howling has already stopped.@
` The mansion is so quiet, I can hear the clock ticking in the silence.\

`"------?"@
` I hear it again.@
` …… Inside the mansion…… from the lobby?@
`"-----Could it be a burglar?"@
` It's not impossible.@
` The mansion's contents are outrageously valuable.@ On top of that, with no one here now except Kohaku-san, Hisui, Akiha and myself, it's very insecure.@
`"……………"@
` I get out of bed, and slip out of the room quietly.\

` …… If it's a burglar, Akiha and everyone will be in danger, so I can't let this one go.@
` I'll just look down from the second floor into the lobby; that should be safe enough.\

`"Aki…… ha?"@
` She's not going to her own room on the second floor, but to the first floor of the west wing.@
` The only things there are Kohaku-san's room and my old man's room.\

`"…… What's she doing at this time of night……?"@
` I can murmur all I want, but there won't be any answers forthcoming.@
` After gazing at the lobby for a while, I decide to return to my room.\

` ……… Well, she probably had something to do, or went to see Kohaku-san.@
` I feel bad about sneaking around and watching her, and I don't want to just ask her about everything she does.@
`"…… Sleep, sleep.@ There's school tomorrow."@
` I bury myself in bed and close my eyes.@
