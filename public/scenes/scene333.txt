` I walk with Akiha towards the mansion.@
`"……"@
` Frankly, it's difficult.@
` If I look beside me, I can see Akiha walking with her long hair fluttering.@
` Akiha is silent and graceful, the perfect daughter of a respected family.\

`"………"@
` Why can't I think of anything to say?@
` Even though I see Akiha at home every day, I somehow feel some tension walking home toward the mansion.\


br
` --But I still haven't had an explanation.@
br
`"Akiha."@

`"Yes?@ What is it, Nii-san?"@
`"What is it!?@ Why have you transferred to this school?@ What possible reason could you have for transferring to a second-rate elevator school!?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"So you say, Nii-san.@ But I can go to school wherever I choose; I do not need to explain myself to you."@
`"…… Don't be stupid.@ I'm your brother!@ I can't just overlook things that are against your best interests.@
` Frankly, I can't see any benefit in you transferring to this school.@ Since our old man isn't around anymore, it's my responsibility to look out for you…!"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t16a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… What?@ It's not fair to say things like that at times like these."@
`"'Not fair' is my line.@ What were you thinking, transferring without even telling me?@
` I won't accept this transfer until I hear a good reason!"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t19.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah----"@
`"If I'm not satisfied with the reason, I'll send you right back to your own school.@ So, tell me, Akiha.@ Why did you change schools?"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Akiha falls silent and looks down.@
` A very brief moment later, she raises a brave face.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… I was worried about you, Nii-san.@ Is that not a sufficient reason?"@
br
` -------Eh?@
br
`"…… Ha, hang on.@ What do you mean, worried about me…?"@
` What sort of reason is that for transferring?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well, looking at your unruly behavior recently, I decided that in order to prevent you from disgracing the Tohno name, I would have to keep a close eye on you."@
` Akiha explains clearly.@
`"Erk----"@
` When she says "unruly behavior", I can't help but nod.@
` It's true, my everyday life since coming here has surely been an annoyance to Akiha and the others.\

`"Bu, but, transferring is still a bit much, isn't it?@ What about your friends?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t05a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's none of your concern, Nii-san.@ If you feel even a little bad for me, then all you have to do is change your way of thinking from now on."@
` Akiha turns sharply away.@
br
` …… Well, this is just the way she is.\

`"…… Alright, do as you please.@ But one day, you'll regret it."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's fine.@ I wasn't thinking of having you worry over me, Nii-san."@
` With a sound of exasperation, Akiha starts to sulk.@
` We fall silent, and continue up towards the mansion.\

` We arrive at the mansion.@
` Akiha steps forward to open the gate, but as if remembering something, turns to me.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… I have one question.@ How close are you to that person called Ciel, Nii-san?"@
` Abruptly, she asks an extremely forward question.@
`"Not especially close.@ We're just friends from school.@ She… feels like someone I can talk to."@

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

`"Really?" Akiha says, turning away and going through the gates.\

` We cross the courtyard and arrive at the door.@
` As Hisui is not waiting at the gates and Kohaku is not sweeping the garden, there is no sign of either of them today.\

`"Ah."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes?@ Did you say something, Nii-san?"@
`"Well, nothing much but… I'd like to go and take a look at the Japanese-style building you were talking about, if that's okay."@
`"----The detached building?"@
` Murmuring, Akiha's brow creases with concern.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Please, do not.@ It was sealed up many years ago.@ Nii-san, even you are not permitted to go there."@

cl a,%type_lshutter_fst

` Having stated this, Akiha goes into the mansion.\
