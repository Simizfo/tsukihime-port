` I'm cold.@

` There,

` …… I keep bleeding.@
` In my groggy state,
` I can hear Arcueid and someone else arguing.\

`"I cannot leave it to you.@ I will heal him."@
` A horribly hostile voice.@
`"Don't do anything you shouldn't.@ This is mine, so it doesn't concern you."@
` Arcueid sounds the same too.@
br
` …… She sounds the same, but I wish she wouldn't selfishly make me her object.\

`"Yes, this certainly does not concern me right now.@
` However, I do not think you can heal such wounds.@ All you can do is watch him die.@
` Or----do you intend on making this young man one of your subordinates, Arcueid Brunestud?"@
`"…… Do you think I would do such a thing?"@
` …… I can hear more than hostility in their voices.@
` There's so much tension I expect another fight to the death to start.\

`"Then please be quiet.@ With those wounds, he cannot last long."@
`"---I really hate you.@ You should just disappear before I kill you."@
`"I really hate you as well.@ You don't need to tell me anything; I plan on leaving once his wounds are healed.@
` You yourself should disappear before I kill you.@ I can't stand seeing you around."@

` …… Wow, I really am back to normal.@ I don't feel pain or dizziness.@ Just how in the world did you do it, Arcueid?"@

`       "Immortality".@
\

` If those words are to be a grand reality, it would be one of the things which would define eternity.@
` But in reality, nothing in existence has reached that level.\

` For example, those vampires occasionally spoken of in legends are not immortal.@
` After all, they are defective because they require stealing from others to exist.@
` Furthermore, the fact that their supplemental parts have to be of the same species---in this case, generally referring to humans----means that they are not versatile at all.@
` They call themselves the transcendent race, but that is not evolution, it is degeneration.@
br
` That which cannot function independently in perpetuity cannot be called eternal.@
` It is presumptuous to call something immortal if it depends on others to halt its aging.\

` There already exists something close to perfection which can function independently in perpetuity.@
` It feeds on itself and multiplies.@ It has no such thing as a lifespan.@ Old cells become food as nutrients and new cells are produced from it.@
` Such as a jellyfish.@
` However, it is perpetual only because it has no intelligence.@
` If having no intelligence is fine, then it is no different from gaining eternity by death.\

` If you want to be eternal living as a human, it is impossible by the method of immortality.@
` Long years destroy the body and wear away flexibility of the mind.\

` Immortality or eternity.@
` I have no attachment to stained immortality.@
` Persistently maintaining individuality makes eternity unattainable.@
br
` Instead of gaining immortality as a single human,
` I chose the infinity in which I continue to exist eternally.\

` …… I see; certainly a different approach than I.@ However, with your method, will you not lose eternity at the extinction of the human race?@
` Your method always requires an unborn child other than yourself.\

` Yes, that is true.@ But if no other humans existed, I would not be able to confirm my own self.@
` So----if humans become extinct, then continuing to live would be worthless.@ At that point, my immortality would end.\

` …… I do not understand your theory.@ That is far from the thesis of eternity, Serpent.\

` No, it is eternity.@ When a time comes to perish, everything should perish.@ If observers cease to exist, then that means everything is unchanging.@
` The eternity I embody is temporary until that time occurs.@
` I cannot turn everything into nothingness.@ Therefore, I will continue living until it happens.@
` …… Although, I have found yet another amusement.\

` Is that why you called me?\

` Yes.@ I will show you a mystic method which allows you to slightly shape what is inside of you.@ There is someone I wish for you to catch using this achievement from the age of the gods, Chaos.\
