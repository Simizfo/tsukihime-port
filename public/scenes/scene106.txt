` In my dream, I'm staring at the moon.\

` I can't remember where I am or why I'm looking up at it.@
` Maybe I looked up into the night sky not wanting to see anything, and the moon happened to be there.\

` My back creaks.@
` Coursing through my veins is an image of coldness.@
` A solitary darkness that makes me dizzy.@
` A radiant moon that sickens my heart.\

` …… Strange.@
` The overwhelming coldness feels more like a sense of nostalgia.\
