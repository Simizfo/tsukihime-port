` ---I gather up my courage and ask her about last night.@

`"…… Uh--Senpai.@ Last night, were you in the park?@ I thought I saw you wearing something like a black coat, with your skirt flowing in the wind."@

`"…… What is that?"@
`"Um……!@ well--yeah, the high-laced boots suited you.@ I was kind of fascinated, you looked… really cool."\

` ……"Huh?" Senpai tilts her head.@
` She frowns like she doesn't understand my words completely, and then denies it.\


`"Um, I don't quite understand, but you're saying that I was near your house two nights ago, looking like that?"@
`"Yeah.@ Senpai, that was you, right?"@

`"No way.@ Tohno-kun, are you saying I look like I really have that much free time?"@
` ---Senpai is really angry.@
` She can't be playing ignorant or lying.\

`"Ah----No, that's not it, but I just…… saw someone that looked like you in park last night, so---"@
` Senpai gives a sigh.@

`"Tohno-kun, that wasn't me.@ I don't have that kind of hobby."@
`"Ah---Yeah, I know.@ I just wanted to ask."\

` Certainly after having her say that, she is right.@
` Ciel-senpai and the person that night aren't related at all.@
` In the first place, Senpai's just a normal person, and if she was actually there---she had to have seen me kill that vampire with my knife.@
` If she saw such a gruesome scene, there'd be no way she could talk with me normally like this.\

`"…… Sorry, please forget about it.@ I guess it was just someone else."@

`"That's fine, but…… did that person really look like me?@ That weird person?"@
`"Well, I'm not too sure.@ It was dark, and far away………… huh?"@
` Yeah, it was far and I couldn't make out her face.@
` So why did I think it looked like Senpai……?@
`"…… Hmm… Maybe there is something wrong with me."@
` I cross my arms and think.\
