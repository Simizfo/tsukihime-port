` When I came to, I was lying on a hospital bed.@
` The curtain on the nearby window sways gently.@
` It is a beautiful day outside,
` and the dry wind signals the end of summer.\

`"Hello, Tohno Shiki-kun.@ Congratulations on your recovery."@
br
` The unfamiliar old man extends his hand for a handshake.@
` His square-rimmed glasses and warm smile are very befitting.@
` His tidy-looking white clothes suit him perfectly, too.\

`"Can you understand what I am saying, Shiki-kun?"@
`"…… No.@ Why am I in a hospital?"@
`"You don't remember, do you?@ You were involved in a car accident while you were walking.@
` Your chest was stabbed by a shard of glass, and it was unlikely that you would survive."@
` Very unbefitting of what a doctor would say, yet he says it while still smiling cheerfully.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
` ------Terrible.@
`     I feel terrible.\

`"…… I'm tired.@ Can I go to sleep?"@
`"Yes, you should rest.@ You must focus on recuperating, and not push yourself."@
` The doctor is still smiling.@
` To be honest, I can't stand that smile anymore…
`"Can I ask you something, doctor?"@
`"What is it, Shiki-kun?"@
`"Why are there scribbles all over your body?@ And there are cracks, all over the walls… Why are there cracks in the walls?"@
br
` The smile vanishes for just a brief moment, then returns to his face immediately.@ He turns and walks away.\

`"---It seems there was some brain damage after all.@ Get a hold of Dr. Ashiya in neurology.@ I also suspect he may have suffered some damage to his eyes.@ Spend the afternoon examining his eyes."@
br
` The doctor whispers to the nurse so that I won't hear him.\

`"……… Weird.@ There are scribbles all over everyone's bodies."@
` The sloppy, zigzagging black lines, running all over the floors, walls, the ceiling…
` I don't understand what they mean, but looking at them makes me feel sick.@
`"…… I wonder what it is."@
` The bed too, is covered in these scribbly lines.@
` When I touch the line with my finger, my fingertip sinks down into the crack.@
`"---Oh!"@
` It seems as if I could reach farther down with something narrower, so I trace the line with a fruit knife that was lying on the bedside table.\

` I didn't use any strength at all, yet the knife sinks into the bed, all the way up to the hilt.@
` It was fun, so I drag the knife along the scribbly line.@
br
` THUD!@
br
` With a heavy sound, the bed snaps cleanly in two.@
`"Kyaaaah!"@
br
` The girl in the bed next to mine screams.@
` The nurses run over and take the knife away from me.\

`"How did you break the bed, Shiki-kun?"@
br
` The doctors don't ask why, but curiously persist on HOW I did it.\

`"I traced along that line and it broke.@ Hey, just why is this hospital full of cracks?"@
`"You'd better stop with that, Shiki-kun.@ There are no such cracks like that anywhere.@
` Now tell me, just how did you break the bed?@ You can tell me, I promise I won't get mad."@
`"---I'm telling you, all I did was just trace the line with the knife…"@
`"…… I see.@ Okay, we'll continue this conversation tomorrow."@
br
` The doctor leaves.@
` In the end, not a single person believed my story.\

` As long as I run the knife along the scribbles, I can cleanly cut anything.@
` I don't have to put any force into it.@
` It is as easy as cutting paper with scissors.@
` The bed, the chair, the desk, the walls, the floor.@
br
` ……I've never tried, but probably… no, definitely, even people.\

` But it seems that no one else can see these lines.@
` The black lines only I can see.@
` Despite being a kid, I gradually began to understand what the lines were.@
` They are probably like stitches.@
` Just like stitches that hold an open wound together after surgery, I think they are weak spots.@
` After all, there's no way I could cut such a thing with a child's strength alone.@
br
` ----Yeah, I didn't know until now.@
br
` That the world is covered in these lines, these "breaking lines" that bind everything together.\

` No one else can see them.@
` That's why they are just fine.@
` But I can see them.@
` I'm scared… so scared, I can't even talk…@
` It's as if I am the only one who went crazy.\

` Maybe… that's why?@
` Why even after two weeks, no one believes my story.@
` Even after two weeks, no one has come to see me.@
br
` Even after two weeks,
` I continue to live alone in a world surrounded by black stitches…\

` I need to get out… I don't want to be in this room anymore.@
` I don't want to stay in a place covered in stitches.@
` That's why I decided to escape, and run away, to somewhere where no one else would be.@
br
` But the wound on my chest still hurts, and I didn't get very far.@
` That was when I noticed.@
` I'm standing in the grassy field just outside of town... I really didn't get far at all.\


`"…… *cough*"@

` My chest hurts… and I feel so sad… I collapse to my knees and cough.@

br
` I hear a woman's voice from behind me.\


`"Eh………?"@
`"What do you mean, 'eh'?@ You're already a runt so I can't see you if you're sitting in the grass.@ I was this close to kicking you, so watch out."@
` She points at me rather grumpily.@
` …… I get a little angry.@
` After all, I sit in the fourth row from the front so I don't think I'm that short.@
`"Kicked?@ By who?"@
`"Isn't it obvious, stupid?@ You and I are the only ones here, so who else could it be but me?"@
` She declares this confidently as she folds her arms.\

`"Well, I suppose it must be fate that we met here, so you want to talk for a little while?@ My name is Aozaki Aoko.@ What's yours?"@
` She extends her hand to me with the kind of cheerfulness one would show an old friend.@
` I see no reason to refuse, so I tell her my name is Tohno Shiki and grasp her cool hand in return.\

` Talking to her was a lot of fun.@
` She didn't ignore what I said just 'cause I was a kid.@
` Instead, she listened… she listened to what I had to say, like a friend.\

` We talked about many, many things.@
br
` About my family.@ About how it was an old and respected family with very strict, traditional rules, and my equally strict father.@
` About my little sister Akiha… quiet Akiha who always followed me around.@
` About our big mansion and the vast gardens, and how Akiha and I would play together with our friends.@
br
` ---I told her about many things almost feverishly.\

`"Oh, it's this time already.@
` Sorry, Shiki.@ I've got some business to take care of, so let's stop here."@
` She gets up to leave.@
` …… My chest tightens, and I feel sad, thinking that I would be alone again.@

br
`"See you tomorrow.@ I'll be waiting for you here, okay?@ You should go back to your room and listen to your doctor."@
`"Oh…"@
` She speaks with such ease, in such a natural way as she makes her way off.\

`"…… See you tomorrow."@
` Tomorrow, we would be able to talk like we did today.@
` I'm happy.@
` It was the first time I truly felt something since I awoke from the accident.\

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid


` Since that day, going to that grassy field in the afternoons became part of my daily routine.@
` She would get angry when I called her "Aoko".@
` For some reason, it seemed she hated her own name.@
` After some thought, I decided that she seemed like a very distinguished person, so I came to call her "Sensei".\

` Sensei would seriously listen to anything I had to say, and would always dispel my anxieties with but a single word, without fail.@
` …… I was depressed from the accident, but slowly, thanks to Sensei, I began to return to my former self.@
` Even those scary black scribbles didn't seem quite so scary anymore when talking to Sensei.@
` I didn't know who she was or where she was from... perhaps she really was a teacher.@
br
` But I don't care, it doesn't matter at all.@
` Because, it's fun being with Sensei.@
` That alone, is all that matters… and that alone is more than enough.\

`"Hey, Sensei.@ Look what I can do!"@
br
` I wanted to surprise her one day, so using the fruit knife I brought from the hospital, I cut down a tree growing in the field.@
` Like before, I run the knife along the scribble-like line, and cut it cleanly across the base.@

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst


`"Amazing, isn't it?@ I can cut anything easily, as long as it's somewhere where I can see the scribbles.@ No one else can do this right?"@
`"Shiki…!"@
br
` She slaps me across the face.\

bg "image\bg\cmo_03.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Sen… sei?"@
`"…… What you just did was extremely thoughtless."@
` Sensei gives me a hard, piercing glare.@
br
` …… I don't know why,
` but I realized I just did something I definitely shouldn't have done.@
br
` With Sensei's severe expression and the pain from my cheek where she slapped me,
` I felt very, very sad.\

`"…… I'm… sorry."@
` Before I knew it, I was crying.@
`"-----Shiki."@
br
bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` Then, a gentle, warm feeling envelops me.@
br

`"…… There's no need to apologize.@
` It's true that you did something I should be angry at you for, but it's definitely not your fault."@
` Sensei squats down and hugs me.\

`"But you know, if someone doesn't tell you otherwise now, one day you're going to make a mistake you can never take back.@
` That's why I won't apologize… you can hate me all you want, if you feel that way."@
`"…… No, I don't hate you, Sensei."@
`"…… Really?@ I'm glad you feel that way… I guess it was fate that the two of us met here like this."@
` Sensei began to ask about the scribbles I could see.@
` As I told her about the lines, the black jagged lines that somehow only I could see, Sensei's embrace tightened.\

`"…… Shiki, what you are seeing is something that should never be seen, by anyone, or anything.@
` Everything in existence has points where they are most easily broken.@ We, who will break down one day, are imperfect for this reason.@
` Your eyes have the ability to see the fate of all things… to put it another way, you can see the future."@
`"…… See…… the future?"@
`"That's right.@ You can see death.@
` …… You don't need to know any more than that.@
` If someday, you happen to go down that path, the principles will become clear to you as something that is needed."\

`"…… Sensei.@ I really don't understand…"@
`"That's good, it's important that you don't understand now.@
` All I want you to know is that you must never cut these lines on a whim or as a joke, understand?@
` ---If you do so, your eyes will begin to take the lives of others too lightly, and that is the worst thing that can possibly happen."@
`"…… Okay.@ I won't do it if you say so, Sensei.@ Besides, it kind of hurts my chest.@ …… I'm sorry, Sensei.@ I'll never do it again."@
`"…… Good for you, Shiki.@ Never forget the feelings that you have experienced here today.@ If you stay that way, I'm sure you'll find happiness."@
br
` Sensei finally lets go of me.\


bg "image\bg\ima_05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"But Sensei, I see those lines and get worried.@
` They'll be cut as soon as I trace them, right?@ Then it wouldn't be weird for my surroundings to come apart at any time."@
`"You're right.@ I'll be able to help you with that at least… It seems as if that's the reason why I'm here."@
` Sensei sighs, then favors me with a warm smile.@
`"Shiki, I'll give you a very special present tomorrow.@ I'll give you your old life back, the one you were living before your accident."\

` The next day.@
` Exactly the seventh day after I met Sensei, she arrives in the grassy field carrying a large trunk in one hand.\

`"Here.@ If you put these on, those strange scribbles won't be visible anymore."@
` What she gave me was a pair of glasses.@
`"But my eyes are fine."@
`"Just put them on.@ The lenses don't have any magnification or anything."@
` Sensei forces them on me.@
` Suddenly---\

`"Whoa!@ Incredible!@ This is amazing, Sensei!@ I can't see the scribbles anymore, not at all!"@
`"Of course.@ I had quite a time stealing Mystic Eye Killer from my older sister to make this Aozaki Aoko masterpiece!@ So treat them well or there'll be hell to pay, got it?"@
`"Yup!@ I'll take good care of them!@ You're incredible, Sensei!@ You made all those horrible lines disappear just like that!@ It's like magic!"@
br
`"Of course, I am a sorceress, after all."@
br
` Giving me a proud smile, Sensei puts her trunk down on the ground.\

`"But know this, Shiki.@ Those lines haven't disappeared.@ It's just that you can't see them.@ Once you take the glasses off, you'll be able to see them again."@
`"---R-really?"@
`"Yes.@ That's the one thing that cannot be fixed.@ Your only choice is to keep living your life and do your best with the eyes you have now."@
`"……… No.@ I don't want these scary eyes.@ If I cut those lines again, I'll end up breaking my promise to you."@
`"Oh, you mean never cutting the lines again?@ Silly, you can break that promise whenever you like."@
`"…… Really?@ But you said it was something I shouldn't do."\

`"Yes, it is.@
` But that is your gift, Shiki.@ It's yours to use as you see fit.@ No one else but you has the right to judge you.@
` But out of all the abilities one can have, yours is terribly unique.@
` If you have such a power, that means there is a meaning behind you having it.@
` God doesn't give us powers for no reason.@
` You might say that you were given the 'Mystic Eyes of Death Perception' because one day, a time will come when you will need them.@
` That's why you must not live in denial of their existence."@
` Sensei squats down so our eyes would be level.\

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_lshutter_slw

`"But you know, that's why you must never forget.@
` You are a very kind and honest person, Shiki.@
` As long as you remain the way you are now, your eyes will never bring forth any wrong."\

`"However, I'm not telling you to become a saint.@
` All I'm saying is live true to yourself, and become a man in the manner that you think is right.@
` Since you can accept your mistakes and are able to apologize, I know that in ten years, you will become a great man."@
br
` That being said,
` Sensei stands, and reaches for her trunk.\

`"Oh, but I must say, unless in exceptional circumstances, you shouldn't take the glasses off.@
` Special powers attract other special powers.@
` Only when you decide there is no other way should you take off those glasses, and even then, be mindful of how you use your power.@
` Power in itself is not evil.@ What is evil rests solely in the hearts of the ones wielding such power.@ Be it for good or evil, it will be up to you and the choices you make."@
br
` She picks up her trunk.@
br
` ---Sensei doesn't say anything more after that,
` but deep down, I knew we would have to part.\

`"---It's impossible, Sensei.@ I can't do it… I won't understand just by myself.@
` The truth is, I was so afraid before I met you.@ I was only able to return to being me, because you were with me…
` …… I can't do it.@
` Not even with these glasses, if you're gone, I can't do it…!"@
`"Don't say such things, Shiki.@ If you tell lies that even you yourself can't believe, you'll only make whoever hears you sad."@
` Sensei raises her eyebrows in displeasure and pokes my forehead.\

`"---You know it yourself, don't you?@
` You're alright now.@ So don't say stupid things and give up on the self that you finally found.@ Only you can choose to be you, no one else can do it for you."@
br
` Sensei turns around.\

`"Well, this is goodbye.@
` Listen, Shiki.@ Life is not easy; everyone's life is a hard, long, rocky road, filled with many pitfalls.@
` You have more power than anyone else to do something about that, so pull yourself together."@
` Sensei is leaving.@
` I was sad, but I'm Sensei's friend, so I have to see her off properly.\

`"Yes.@ Goodbye, Sensei."@
`"Well done… That's right, Shiki.@ Hold onto that confidence, and always live true to yourself.@
` When you find yourself in trouble, calm down and think things through carefully.@ Okay?@ A solution will always present itself if you do.@
` It'll be alright.@ You'll manage, even on your own."@

` I lived a normal life as an adopted son.@
` From the time I met Sensei---those special circumstances Sensei told me about as she parted never happened, and the glasses hid the "lines" from me as long as I wore them.@
` The life of Tohno Shiki was a peaceful one.@
` It meandered along gently…

` I sigh again.@
` To be perfectly honest, even before the accident, I had never gotten along with the Tohno household.@
