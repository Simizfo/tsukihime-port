` Probably after I had become friends with one of the servant girls, and was coming out to play at last.@
br
` ---I'm sorry, Nii-san.@
br
` In the empty courtyard, Akiha suddenly started to cry.@
` Even when I asked what she was apologizing for, she just kept apologizing.\

` ----Because we stole everything from you, Nii-san.@
br
` The reason why Akiha is crying is something that has already ended for me in the past.\
` …… It would be a lie to say I didn't hold a grudge.@
` But, a six year old girl can't feel responsible for that, and it can't be something she would apologize so desperately for.@ In the first place, she didn't do anything wrong.\

` ---I'm sorry.@ I'm sorry, Nii-san.@
br
` …… Why didn't I notice?@
` From the very first time I met Akiha, she was always apologizing to me.@
` In this big mansion, the only one who cried for me.@
br
` ---Thank you.@ But, that's enough.@
br
` Smiling, I stroked Akiha's head.@
` Akiha looked up at me, bewildered.@
` Then, for the first time, I felt strongly…\

` ---You don't have to cry, Akiha.@
` From now on, we're brother and sister.@
br
` …… I remember Akiha's face laughing happily.@
` I made a promise then.@
` We would be a real family.@
` Since I was the elder brother, I would protect Akiha, whatever happened.\

` We're separated.@
` Even though she's away from me, there is a feeling of tension like she's right in front of my face.\

`"Answer me, Nii-san.@ I asked, if I were a blood-sucking demon, what would you do?"@
`"---Akiha, that's…"@
`"If I were to confirm that, there would be no need for me hold back.@ Do you understand, Nii-san?@
` I could stop being obstinate and become more honest with myself, right?"@
` With terrible pressure and a glint of cruel enjoyment in her eyes, Akiha gazes up at me.@
` I shudder as I look at her.@
` Even though Akiha is looking up at me, her gaze is so cold that she seems to be looking down on me.\

`"Wha----"@
` I'm breathing in and I can't speak.@
` Even though we're far apart,
` …… it feels like we're so close we could kiss at any moment.\

` Akiha's eyes are cold as those of a stranger.@
`"Akiha, you---"@
` My voice stops there.@
` Whatever happens---whatever happens, I cannot finish.\

`"Just a joke, Nii-san.@ I don't drink people's blood."@
` With a delightful smile at my hesitant state, Akiha releases her blade-like gaze.\

`"It is just as Ciel said.@ Certainly, members of the Tohno house have something 'different' in their blood.@
` However, that's something that can be told at a glance if it's awake.@ Even you know that, don't you Nii-san?"@
` Akiha teases with a laugh.\

`"I… know…?"@
`"Yes.@ So, your question is meaningless.@ Because I am not what you think I am, Nii-san.@
` Well then, is that all?@ In that case, I am going home."@
` Akiha is about to leave.@
` But, no.@
` …… If I miss this chance, I feel there will be no more chances.@
` Having come this far, I can't let her go without asking her everything.\

`"…… No, there's still something I want to ask.@ About the other child, when we were children."@
`"You're really persistent, Nii-san.@ Didn't I tell you there was no other child?"@
`"That's not true.@ Our old man adopted a kid ten years ago."@
`"--------"@
` Akiha raises her eyebrows.@
` It's not like her previous reaction, a hiding of guilt.@ It's more like anger.\


`"…… I see, Hisui has been troublesome.@ I told her to take care not to let you discover that."@
` Akiha sighs.\

`"…… Akiha.@ There was a third child.@ Even I remember vaguely.@ Can't you tell me?@ He… why did he die?"@
`"No.@ That child did not die."@
`"---Eh?"@
`"But he was killed.@ …… By your hands, Nii-san."@
`"Wha---I, killed---?"@
` Saying that.@
` Dizziness assaults me.\

` Since I don't feel like returning to the mansion, I merely sit on the bench in the park, thinking.\

`"…… Kuh."@
` Akiha drinking Kohaku-san's blood.@
` Akiha saying the Tohno family is inhuman.@

`"…… Then, the person seeing that dream…"@
` It couldn't have been Akiha, who was being watched.@
` If Akiha is a vampire, she would never see that.@
`"--Yeah.@ There's no way Akiha could be the killer!"@
` Saying that, I jump off the bench.@
` Though I will be embarrassed later, I run around the park.\

`"Ha, haha, hahahaha-----!"@
` I don't care about how people think.@
` I just run around happily, laughing.@
` Because this means I can protect Akiha from now on.@
