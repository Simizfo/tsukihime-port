` …… Akiha isn't the only person I haven't seen since then.@
` I can't remember all the details because it's been eight years, but there were other children at the mansion around the same age as me.\

` I don't remember their names, but there were two girls who were twins.@
` Father has once said that they didn't have any relatives, so he took them to work as servants.@
`"…… That's weird.@ We played together so often when we were small, but I can't remember their names."@
` I close my eyes and cast my mind back.\

` I should be able to remember.@
` She was a girl who was always cheerful… so cheerful that you would become cheerful just by looking at her.@
` A girl with a carefree personality who was loved by everyone at the mansion.@
` Because she was close to my age, I got along very well with her, and it seemed like every day we would run around the garden together.@
`"Let's play together, Shiki-chan."@
` She would say, and I could remember her taking me out of my room after I secluded myself inside.\

` She would often laugh and take shy Akiha's hand, trying to make her play with us.@
` Maybe she was older than the both of us.@
` She would guide me and Akiha to play together, but once we started playing, she would just watch over us.@
` Even Akiha's tutor, the harsh butler, would say "I don't mind, as long as ****** is with you guys", and let Akiha out to play, as if there was no helping it.\

` In contrast to that girl was the other one.\

` On the second floor.@
` While we played in the garden, there was always a girl looking down at us every time I turned to look at the mansion.\

` She was the twin of that cheerful girl, but she would always gaze at us expressionlessly.@
` That girl would never try to leave the house.@
` All she would do was watch us with those cold eyes.\

` ---Well, in the end, I only ended up talking a little with her.\

`"I wonder if those girls are still at the mansion…"@
` While I think about that, I take a white ribbon out of my bag.@
` An old white ribbon that the girls gave me at the very end.\

` ---Eight years ago.@
` After I was involved in the accident.@
` The day I was entrusted to the Arima family.@
br
` Right before I was to leave the mansion, the girl gave me this for some reason.@
br
` …… I'm just lending it to you, so be sure to return it.@
` Saying something along those lines, she ran off.\

` Afterwards, I was quickly found by one of the servants and taken to the front entrance.@
` With no one to see me off, I walked out of the gates of that giant mansion while the Arima lady held my hand.@
br
` It was my last memory of when I left the Tohno mansion, eight years ago.\

` *sigh*@
` I put the ribbon back in my bag.@
`"But it's been eight years, after all…"@
` Not only do I not know if they are still at the mansion, I can't even remember their names.@
` To make things worse, I can't even remember which girl gave me the ribbon.\

`"…… Still, it's not like it was some important promise or anything."@
` But I want to keep the promise, as long as I still remember it.@
` I agreed to return to the mansion because Akiha is now there all by herself.@
` I left her there for eight years, pushing all responsibility onto her while I selfishly lived freely.@
br
` I am going back because I feel guilty for what I did to her.@
` …… I didn't exactly plan to use this as an opportunity to do so, but if that girl is still at the mansion, I want to properly fulfill the promise from eight years ago.\
