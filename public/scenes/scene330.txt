` …… I feel… a little dizzy.@
` The classroom dyed by the evening glow.@
` Alone, a girl with long, faintly red hair is preparing to leave.@

` No matter how I look at her, she's Akiha.@
` So why?@ Why do I feel as if I am seeing a stranger for the first time?\

` Akiha addresses me in her usual tone.@
` …… Looking at Akiha's black hair, I feel that without a doubt, this is my own little sister, Tohno Akiha.\

`"Yes… if you don't mind, let's walk home together."@
` For some reason, Akiha smiles tenderly.@
` …… My heart thumps.@
` Perhaps it's the dizziness from earlier, or perhaps the strangeness of seeing Akiha in my own school.@
` For some reason, my heart beats far harder than it needs to.\
