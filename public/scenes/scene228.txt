`"----Eh?"@
` I turn around.@
` Indeed, desks are strewn about and chairs overturned everywhere.\

`"Yeah--yeah, I'm tired and it's making me act weird."@
` I take a deep breath.@
` …… Is it because I saw Senpai's face?@
` That headache and the irritation I had before vanishes like it was never there.\

`"What a coincidence.@ I was just thinking that I should go back too.@ Since it happens to work out, can I go back with you?"@
`"No, I really appreciate the offer, but…… isn't your house in the opposite direction?@ We can't exactly walk back together."@
`"I know, so we'll be together until the gate."@

` She really is cheerful.@
` How should I say this?@ Just seeing her drives away the clouded feelings I had earlier.@
` Having such a great person ask me to come with her, I ought to be punished if I was still gloomy.\

`"…… Okay, let's go.@ But, it's a pretty short trip to the front gate."@

` Senpai starts to walk.@
` Following her, I leave the darkening classroom behind me.\
