`"Yes.@ Good morning, Shiki-san."@
` Kohaku-san delivers her ordinary morning greeting with a smile on her face.\

`"Did you sleep well last night?@ I was worried that you might be inconvenienced, staying in an unfamiliar mansion and all."@
`"Ah, no, there were no problems.@ I used to live here, after all, and now I've got you to watch over me, Kohaku-san."@

`"Oh, you're quite good at this, Shiki-san."@
`"Eh?@ No, I'm just saying what I think… what is it I'm good at?"@
` Kohaku-san just looks at me, smiling.@

`"Ah… hey there."@
` I give a light wave to greet her.@
` Akiha continues to stare at me… or perhaps, glare would be a better word.\
`"Well… um… good morning, Akiha."@

`"Oh?@ You don't have to force yourself to greet me.@ Please, go right ahead and ignore me.@ After all, it seems you'd prefer to enjoy the morning with Kohaku."@
`"Uuh…"@
` Akiha's words sting.@
` …… It's not like I had intended to ignore her.@ I just said hello to Kohaku-san…\

`"Please don't tease Shiki-san too much, Akiha-sama.@ We don't have much time, and Shiki-san hasn't finished his breakfast yet."@

`"Well, that's Nii-san's fault for waking up late, isn't it?@ He's just getting what he deserves for leaving everything to do in a rush in the morning."@
`"Hmph!" Akiha sniffs.@
` …… It seems like my failure to greet her was another point she was unimpressed with, in addition to her objection to my late arrival.\
`"Um… Kohaku-san.@ Is my breakfast ready?"@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes, I've laid it out in the dining hall.@ Please, eat up at your leisure."\

`"That won't do, Kohaku.@ Nii-san has no time to eat breakfast at this time."@
`"Hey, listen, Akiha.@ It's only seven, so I've got at least that much.@ It's an easy thirty minute walk from here to school, so I can take it easy for at least ten minutes, can't I?"@
`"Are you saying you're going to finish breakfast in just ten minutes?@ You're not some starving dog, so if you're going to eat breakfast, I'd like you to take your time."@
`"------"@
` Akiha's words really do have thorns in them.\
