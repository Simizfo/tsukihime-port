` I still want to continue living in the proper, respectable world.@
` …… I do feel responsible for killing Arcueid.@
` But, I think there's something wrong about being forced to do something I can't do.@

` But even so… I can't do it.@
` I quietly start to walk.@
` …… Turning my back to Arcueid, sleeping with complete faith in me, I leave the hotel room.\

` I've killed her once, and yet she said she would forgive me.@
` She had forgiven me---and yet… what am I doing here?\

` After I killed Arcueid, I swore to myself that I would atone for it no matter what.@
