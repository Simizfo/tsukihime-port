` …… That's right.@ She's been taking care of me since yesterday, so if I have time to fool around, I ought to go help Hisui.\

` ---Well then.@
` Hisui said she'd be cleaning the mansion, but where could she be?@

` I go down to the lobby.@
` She wasn't in the hallway on the second floor, so maybe she's in the sitting room?@

` She's not anywhere on the first floor.@
` The only place I haven't been are the locked recreation rooms, the guest rooms, and the salon where Akiha is right now.@
`"…… I guess she's on the second floor then."@
` It is a big mansion, so there's probably a bunch of places I haven't looked.@
` Psyching myself up, I start up the stairs.\

` I go up the stairs and glance down the hallway.@
` And then,
` I see Hisui's silhouette standing by the window in the east hall of the mansion.\

`"Hisu--"@
` My voice dies in my throat.@
` In the middle of the hallway.@
` In the twilight, between light and shadow, Hisui stands motionless.\

`"------"@
` …… I can't… speak.@
` Something about her seems… dangerous.@
br
` Hisui lingering in the gloom of this western-style mansion.@
` She seems so incredibly beautiful; but at the same time, a chill runs through me, as if I were looking at a ghost.@
br
` She doesn't even move a finger.@ She simply stares out the window.@
`"------"@
` That window.@
` Is that the same one she watched us from back then?\

`"Hisu----i"@
` I can't do anything but stare in fascination.@
` I'm so dumbstruck I can't speak, or even blink.@ I can only watch her.@
br
` ----And then.@
` Her eyes, still like that of a doll's, suddenly turn towards me.\

`"Shiki-sama, is something wrong?"@
`"Ah---no, nothing, I just, um……"@
`"?"@
` Hisui tilts her head in curiosity.@
` That seems to break the mysterious spell I was under.\

`"I was looking for you because I had some free time and thought I'd give you a hand.@ For some reason, I couldn't find you, but I made it."@
`" …… I see.@ But Shiki-sama, there is no need for you to do that.@ Please return to your room."@
`"Hmmm………"@
` I thought it would turn out like this, Hisui doesn't want me to do any work.\

`"But Hisui, I don't have anything else to do.@ I don't like just doing nothing, so I thought I ought to pitch in."@
`"Shiki-sama, you may say that, but there is no longer any work that you might assist me with.@ The only thing that remains is to arrange Akiha's bedroom.@
` No males are allowed to enter Akiha's bedroom.@ Not even you, Shiki-sama."@
`"Hmmmm…………"@
` Well, that's definitely true.@
` …… But, it is a little cruel.@ She didn't have to emphasize that last part.\

`"Please excuse me, I have to finish my duties."@

` Her footsteps echo in the air and she goes into Akiha's bedroom.@
`"…………… Sheesh."@
` I can't just go into a girl's bedroom because I have free time.@
`"…… Oh well, I guess I'll go back to my room."@
` I turn on my heels.@
` Before doing so, I get curious about the window Hisui was staring out of.@
`"Huh---isn't that Kohaku-san in the courtyard?"@
` You can see the whole courtyard from this window.@
` Was Hisui looking out into the courtyard from this window just as she did when she was a child……?\
