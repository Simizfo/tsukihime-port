` …… Wait a minute.@
` All of that happened, and Senpai still greeted me with her usual smile.@
` Last night----if she saw me fighting Nrvnqsr, then she definitely can't just greet me like this.\

`"Tohno-kun?@ Did you want to say something?"@
`"Um, hold on."@
` …… If I think back, that person who helped me last night may not have looked like Ciel-senpai at all.@
` I couldn't get a good look at her face because it was dark, and her atmosphere was completely different.\

`"Senpai, could I get a good look at your face?"@
`"Uh, yes?"@
` She curiously tilts her head and looks up at me.@
br
` …… Of course.@
` Once I think it through calmly, that person didn't resemble Senpai at all.\

`"…… Sorry, it's just a mistake.@ It's nothing, so please forget about it."@
`"A mistake?@ I'm a little interested--Mistake about what?"@
` She still stares up into my face.@
`"Uh…… It's, ummm."@
` Looking away, I try to hide my blushing face.@
` …… Having her so close to me at the school gate is embarrassing.\

`"N, nothing.@ I just thought I saw someone that looked like you last night, but it must have been a mistake."@
`"…… Hmm, a person that looked like me?"@
` Senpai gives a very interested nod.@
` It seems she isn't going to just forget about it.\
