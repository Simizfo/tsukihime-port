` Her cool hand on my shoulder and her low body temperature are so cold that I hear a creaking, freezing noise.\

` The sound didn't come from anywhere around me.@
` It's just that my body is freezing as the cold penetrates deep inside from where she touches me.@
` In other words, the sound is coming from inside me.@
` My heart, my guts, my brain, they are creaking.\

`"--------Ah."@
` Just like a cancerous cell.@
` Rapidly, limitlessly, unordered, and lacking intelligence.@
` Violating me from inside out.\

` …… I can't feel her breath.@
` Like a ravenous beast, she just bites into my neck.@
` At the same time----

` I descend into a limitless hell of pain, as if my nerves were being torn apart one by one.\

`"----cueid----"@
` My frying mind manages to utter this last word.\

` It, hurts.@
