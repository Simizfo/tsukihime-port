`"Well then, I promised to tell you what I know.@ What do you want to hear, Tohno-kun?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ahh, I see.@ Well, let's start with the dreams you have, Tohno-kun.\


`"To put it simply, I don't think the dream you're seeing is your dream.@
` Tohno-kun, you say you dream of killing, but isn't the dream more like watching someone killing someone else?"@
`"…… Well yeah.@ Do you think I would kill people in my dreams if I could control myself?"\


`"See, that's what I mean.@ When you sleep, you go into the killer's mind.@ Well, not exactly going into but more like being taken into.@
` So, even though your viewpoint was that of the killer, didn't you feel as though you were watching things from afar?"@
`"…………"@
` That's---precisely right.@
` Even though I've had dreams about killings for a while now, they've all felt as if I were watching a "scene".\

`"But, why is my mind and this killer's mind merging?@ There must be some reason, right?"@
`"…… Yes, there's a very clear reason.@ But let us leave that aside for a moment.@ First, we have to discuss what you are calling the killer."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t06c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Certainly, there is a killer.@ But it's characteristics are more like a vampire's."@
`"…… That's fair enough.@ Certainly, you could call someone like that a vampire."@
` I remember the scene in my dream.@
` That guy, while enjoying the killing, he ate their flesh and blood.\

`"Yes.@ I am the person who came to this town to deal with that vampire.@
` …… Although I can't tell you the details, the world has various defense mechanisms.@ Just like there are police to deal with those who break the law, there are also many organizations which deal with heretics who are inhuman.@
` …… Think of me like a member of that kind of organization."\

`"…… Deal with vampires?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ That which sucks the blood of the living to maintain its own flesh.@ A stopped life which does so in order to have eternal life.@
` It is my role to wipe out such heretics.@
` That's the reason I was fighting the vampire every night in your dreams."@
`"------"@
` There's nothing to say.@
` To be honest, I don't understand the world she's talking about at all.\

`"…… Huh?@ So you've fought the vampire several times already?"@
`"Twice now.@ The first time it escaped, and the second time, our encounter was rather painful."@
`"Right?@ So, you've seen his face, haven't you?@ So didn't you know immediately I wasn't the vampire?"@
`"No.@ Unfortunately, I couldn't be certain.@ Since some vampires can change their bodies freely, you cannot rely on appearance to identify them."@
`"…… Really.@ That's a problem, then."\

`"But, now it's clear.@ So we've beaten around the bush, but this vampire is the serial killer then?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t06c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ The dead bodies reported as victims of the serial killer are merely leftover food.@
` Usually the flesh is consumed completely, or the blood is drained and they become vampires too, so there shouldn't be any bodies left."@
`"…… Hold on.@ If people who get their blood sucked turn into vampires, then wouldn't they start multiplying?"\

`"No, there is a limit to those who are killed by having their blood sucked, yet 'remain' without dying.@ Most humans cannot separate the soul from the body, so the soul dies with the death of the body.@
` Only perhaps one in a hundred people can 'remain' without dying.@
` …… Like Yumizuka Satsuki did."@
`"Wha---Senpai, you knew about Yumizuka?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No.@ By the time I got there, you had already destroyed her.@
` …… I'm sorry.@ Back then, even though I knew you were in pain, I couldn't help you."\

`"----No, it's alright.@ I want to think that what happened with Yumizuka was for the best.@
` …… But, I see now.@ Yumizuka wasn't a vampire from the beginning.@ She was attacked by that vampire, and that was the result---"@
`"Yes, that's true.@
` But I don't think there are others like Yumizuka-san.@ It takes many years before a vampire can function as a vampire.@
` For her to be able to function immediately, Yumizuka Satsuki must have had amazing spiritual conception."\

`"Eh…?@ Spiritual conception?@ What's that?"@
`"A functional extent of the brain determined when a person is an embryo---or so it is said.@ Like how you use your ability, it is employing a section of the brain most people never use.@
` The same for Yumizuka Satsuki.@ She was naturally 'suitable'.@ So, instead of being under the control of her parent vampire, she became a vampire that could act independently."@
br
` I don't understand Senpai's explanation.@
` But, one thing occurs to me.\

`"Senpai.@ You mentioned my abilities… so, you know about my eyes…?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Eyes?@ No, I don't know what kind of eyes you have, Tohno-kun, but I know that you have an unique ability.@
` Tohno-kun's blood is special.@ Not a trained ability like mine, but something you are born with.@
` Those kind of things are called 'supernatural powers'.@ Most people have only one channel open in their minds, but you have another channel open that we can't see, right?"\

`"…… Special blood… you mean, the blood of the Tohno house…?"@
`"Yes, the Tohno bloodline is ancient.@
` But looking at the history of the Tohno family, one can see the abilities of its members are varied.@ Such as those who can receive divine inspiration, those unable to maintain their shape as humans and become killers, or those who never awaken to their power.@
` …… As time passed, this blood has thinned and probably most of these abilities do not occur anymore."\

`"----"@
` I'm aghast.@
` If what Senpai says is true, then not just me, but Akiha will also have something "broken" like my eyes…?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shall I continue?@
` Tohno-kun, you asked a while ago.@ Why are your senses merging with those of the vampire?"@
`"Ah… ah, yes, I did…"@
`"I think that is also related to your abilities.@
` Your brain has a larger channel than other people's.@ Because of that, when you sleep and your sense of self dims, your mind is drawn towards a vampire which has an easily connectable brain with you."\

`"Huh…?@ Senpai, what do you mean, an easily connectable brain?@ You can't mean they are made similarly, right?"@
`"No, that is precisely what I mean.@
` Have you ever heard of twins sharing experiences?"@
`"Twins sharing experiences…?"@
`"For instance, if the elder brother is injured, the younger brother who's miles away feels the same pain.@ I think that your dreams are similar to this.\

`"Fundamentally, identical twins are two humans' flesh born from the same genes.@
` They are body parts made from the same instructions, so it isn't impossible for pain felt by one brain to be received by the other."\

`"The brain is an organ that manages reception and transmission.@ Since every person's brain is made from a different blueprint, we have to communicate our feelings through language.@ But if two brains are precisely the same, thought will be transmitted without the need for language.@
` To put it in the previous terms, since the brain's channel is on the same frequency, the electric signal is received.@
` Since your brain is superior to others', you connect to the bodies close to you."\

`"…… It can't be.@ I don't have any twin."@
`"I know.@ But in your case, it doesn't need to be a twin.@
` It's not like you are merging with them, but more like you have similar brains.@ Since your brain has many channels, there is no need for you to be identical twins.@
` Simply the same roots, a similar body… that's probably all that is needed for you to be drawn in.@
` Probably a sibling with the same parents… Well, I suppose an exception could be made in the case of organ transplants; the 'flesh' might pull on your mind in that case."\

` Akiha is the only blood relative I have left now.@
