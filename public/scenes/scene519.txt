` Merci!@
` Now for the hint corner for the poor Tohno-kun who reached a Dead End in midst of the climax,
` It is time for "Teach me, Ciel-sensei!"@
` It would have been better to quit, but this corner is already into the second day.@
` At this rate, we might go on until the third day, which makes me feel a little sick.@
br
` Then, let's begin the first period lesson.\


` Oh geez.@
` That's why I told you, Tohno-kun.@
` You shouldn't trust Arcueid.@

` ----Well then.@
br
` To the Tohno-kun who came here.@
` It's hard to say, but you have to resubmit from quite a while back.@
` The feelings for you that were born inside of Arcueid were unfortunately weaker than her urges as a vampire.@
` Please go back one or two days and try strengthening the bond with her.@
br
` Oh yes, and one more thing.@
` Tohno-kun, even though you were enchanted, I don't think it's good to easily go crazy.\
