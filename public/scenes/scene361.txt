`"Wasn't that just a dream?@ You're just an ordinary high school student.@ You have my word."@
`"Just an ordinary…!@ Even if it is a dream, someone who enjoys murder every night is living with other normal people!@ Even I feel bad about being bad……!"\

` ---Yes, feeling the urge to kill people.@
br
` Not merely in dreams, but I have such desires in reality too.@
` And not strangers; Akiha, the person I know best----\

`"…… A killer, huh.@ Yeah.@ Now that I state it, I understand.@ It's natural for you to come to me every night.@ You can't leave such a dangerous guy alone.@
` So---so, you were going to kill me, Senpai……!?"@

` I grab Senpai's arm around the bandage, and drag her towards me.@

`"…… I don't understand.@ I don't understand anything, Senpai.@
` I don't understand myself anymore.@ So, please, Senpai.@ If you know anything, please tell me…!"@
`"…… Tohno-kun.@ Do you really believe you're the killer?"@
`"I can't think of anything else.@
` …… So, I just want to rest now.@ Since I don't know myself… I want to hear it clearly from you.@
` And then---"@
` Then, even if I have to die, I'll be ready for it.\

`"…… Why…"@

`"Why…… why can't you just laugh it off as always.@ If you did, maybe we could go on like this…"@

` For a moment, I feel dizzy.@
` Even though I said I was ready, hearing the word 'killed' so clearly, my chest hurts.\

`"…… Good.@ Tell me, Senpai."@
`"No, not here.@ I'll be at the school tonight.@ After that, you decide, Tohno-kun."@

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

br
` …… So that means she's leaving the final decision to me.@
` If I go to school tonight, that's the end.@
` But if I don't, we can go back to the way we've always been; a final choice---\

`"…………"@
` I can't say I'll definitely be there, so I say nothing.@

`"Well then, I'll be waiting at school tonight.@
` But, promise me one thing.@ That you will keep this a secret from your younger sister."@
`"Eh?@ From Akiha?"@
` Of course, I wouldn't get Akiha involved in any of this, so there's no need to say that.@
` There isn't, but…
` Why is Senpai asking so seriously?@
` As if saying Akiha was the enemy, not me.\

`"…… Senpai, Akiha has nothing to do with this."@

` ---The lesson finishes, and the students disperse.@
` …… Even if I'm going to meet Ciel-senpai at school tonight, I should return to the mansion first.@

`"Yes.@ Welcome home, Shiki-sama."@
` Hisui bows.@
` …… Thinking about it calmly, a maid bowing in front of a mansion is a terribly anachronistic image.\

`"Oh, by the way, is that Akiha doing any better?"@

`"----No, I shouldn't.@ I… can't see her right now."@
` …… It's not that I'm not thinking about her.@
` But, because of what Ciel-senpai said, it's hard to see her right now.\

`"Shiki-sama.@ Are you not returning to your room?"@
`"Ah, you're right.@ Well then, shall we go in?"@


` Acting cheerful to hide my uneasiness, I pass through the mansion gates.\
