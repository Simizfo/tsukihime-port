`"This is a pretty nice room.@ I'd have no problems spending the night here."@
` Arcueid looks around the hotel room.@
`"-----"@
` I've got nothing to say for now.\
`"My room has probably already been discovered, so let's hide out here for the night.@ Oh, you don't have to worry about money.@ I'm rich, so I'll treat you."@
` Speaking cheerfully, Arcueid closes the curtains.@
` She also turns off the lights and the room becomes as dark as night.\
` I sigh.@
`"…… What are you thinking, Arcueid?"@

`"I'm thinking about all sorts of stuff."@
`"No, that's not what I mean---"@
br
` I'm asking why you've rented a high-class hotel, not a cheap one--and why you rented out the whole top floor.\
`"………"@
` I try to say this, but I stop.@
` Right now, my job is to guard this so-called vampire and nothing more.@ I'm not going to ask any useless questions.@
`"---No, forget it.@ Do whatever you like."@

`"You're weird, Shiki, suddenly getting mad and going silent like that.@ I just don't get you."@
` Arcueid lies on the bed, smiling like she's having fun.@
\
`"I'm going to sleep until the sun sets.@ You'd better rest while you have the chance.@
` Vampires don't move about in the daytime, so you'll be on guard for real during the night."@
`"…… Do you realize you've just said something that completely contradicts your existence?"@
`"Oh, it's alright for me---oh, I guess it's almost my limit.@ Good night, Shiki.@ Wake me up when the sun sets."@

`"H--hey!"@
`"-------"@
` Like a machine whose power is cut off, Arcueid suddenly falls asleep.\
`"Ha-----"@
` She's so… defenseless.@
`"…… Right now, I could run away if I wanted to."@
` She did force me to come with her, after all.@ I could easily run away now.@
` …… And I don't have that impulse anymore, but…

`"I even killed you once, yet…"@

` How is she able to suddenly fall asleep despite that?@
`"………"@
` I look at Arcueid's face as she sleeps on the bed.@
` …… Her plump chest rises and falls.@ It looks like she's breathing.@
` But her body isn't moving at all.@
` It's like the air around her has stopped.@ It's so tranquil even I might stop moving.@
br
` ----What a peaceful slumber.@
br
` A kind of defenselessness as if she had absolute trust in me, even though we've only just met.\
`"---She's so stupid."@
` …… She is so stupidly honest I might start to worry.@
` But aside from that, this is a turning point.@
` This may very well be the point of no return for Tohno Shiki.@
