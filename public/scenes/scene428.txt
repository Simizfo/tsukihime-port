` The instant she passes by the classroom, I'll jump out into the hallway and attack her.@
` If the distance is too great, I'll be killed just like SHIKI.@

` The footsteps keep moving.@
` …… About a distance of two meters.@ At her stride, that should be about eight steps.@
`"……………… Okay."@
` I sneak silently over and place my hand on the door.@
` Tap, tap.@ The hard sound of her footsteps come closer.\

` She hasn't passed the classroom yet.@

` The water in my eyes evaporates instantly and I can't see anything.@
` I don't know anything about what is going on in the outside world.@
` All I can understand is what I'm doing.@
` I'm suspended in mid-air, and just like Kohaku-san earlier, I'm crucified to the wall by Akiha's hair.\

`"How careless.@ It's nothing compared to a natural-born assassin like you, Nii-san, but I can still hide my presence.@
` Well, that's what I did and while you were paying so much attention to the hallway, I came by from the next classroom.@ Next time, you should learn from experience and pay attention to the balcony, too."@
` She giggles.@
`"Ah--------gg!"@
` My neck is being constricted.\
` My limbs have no feeling, as if they were cut off.@ My body is being saturated with Akiha's hair.\

`"Ah, that was rude.@ There is no 'next time' for you, Nii-san.@
` Besides, I'm sorry, Nii-san.@ I rudely ate you instantly.@
` Even though I consumed most of you in the heat of the moment, you are still conscious, right?@ Please forgive my lack of manners since I'll do this right this time."\
