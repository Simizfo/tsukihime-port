` When I get to the sitting room, Akiha is relaxing there alone.@
` There's no sign of Kohaku-san or Hisui.@
` There are two teacups on the table, and Akiha is using one of them.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t09b.jpg",%type_lshutter_mid
`"Oh?@ Do you drink tea after meals, too, Nii-san?"@
`"Ah, no… nothing like that.@ I just thought I'd come and talk to you."@
` My expression tells her, "I'll go away if I'm bothering you."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Then, please, sit down.@ Is tea alright for you?"@
`"Ah, sure; I'll have anything that's nice."@
` I actually prefer Japanese tea, but I'll keep that bit of selfishness to myself.@
` Akiha takes the teapot and pours transparent red tea into another teacup.\

`"Thank you."@
` I sit on the sofa, and raise the teacup to my mouth.@
` …… Before my eyes is the cool and collected Akiha, and it makes me a bit uneasy.@
` I came to talk to her, but to be honest, I really don't know what to say now that she's in front of me.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san?@ You're very quiet.@ Didn't you come to talk to me?"@
` Akiha stares.@
` The atmosphere is not so much that of a younger sister, but more like that of an unfamiliar young lady.@ It's not one in which I can speak freely.\

`"Well… I was just wondering, what you have been doing for the past eight years."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"It goes without saying.@ With Nii-san not around, father's attention turned solely to me."@
` Akiha glares in complaint.@
` It seems that the last eight years are a taboo subject.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"And what about you?@ What have you been doing for eight years?@ I sent many letters, but didn't receive a single reply."@
`"…… Ack."@
` I choke involuntarily.@
` Certainly, Akiha sent many letters.@
` But I never replied.@
` I was a poor correspondent, but at the bottom of my heart I wanted to sever all links with the Tohno mansion, and that made me reluctant to write to Akiha.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well, don't worry about the letters.@ Even if you had answered, I'm sure father would never have allowed the replies into the house.@
` More importantly, how do you feel, returning to the mansion for the first time in eight years?@ It has changed very little… though there was some restoration work done."\

`"-----"@
` In spite of Akiha's words, the mansion still feels completely unknown to me.@
` Eight years ago, I was just a child.@
` Even if I remember the mansion a little, I feel like I'm in someone else's house and it's very unsettling.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Nii-san?"@
`"Ah, no, I was just lost in thought for a moment.@
` Um, you say this mansion's changed very little, but it's pretty unsettling for me.@ Though this sitting room and the lobby are kind of familiar, I can't really remember the corridor, nor my room."@
`"Really… I guess eight years is a long time."@
br
` I guess that's it.@
` It's like half my life so far.@ I can't really expect to have clear memories.\

`"Well, it's been eight years so it doesn't feel right, but I think I'll get used to it.@ I'll be thankful if you overlook my poor manners for a while."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Please, don't be ridiculous.@ I can hardly look any more leniently upon Nii-san's manners than I do already."@
`"Buh…!"\

` Ugh…… That was close.@ I almost sprayed the tea I was drinking.@
` At supper, Akiha's look sent me into a cold sweat after all I did was use the wrong knife.\

`"…… I see.@ You were being lenient back then…"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes.@ I am making concessions appropriate to your abilities.@ Nii-san has been brought up by the Arimas, after all.@
` As Aunt Keiko comes from a branch family, a certain amount of laissez-faire was permitted, and you were spoiled, Nii-san.@ The result is the supper we had a while ago."@
`"Well, it can't be helped, can it?@ We never really thought I'd be returning here."\

`"…… Is that so?@ You almost sound like you didn't want to return, Nii-san."@
`"Don't be stupid, it's not like that.@ I may have had my doubts, but I couldn't just leave you alone here, could I?@ What kind of brother would I be then?"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
br

` Yes.@ That's the reason I returned.@
` If it weren't for Akiha, I would never have returned----\

`"Since I heard nothing for almost eight years, I always wondered whether you were alright on your own.@
` I came back to the mansion because I was worried about you."@
` Looking a little off to the side, I put my honest feelings into words.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t16b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Ah… well, then, thank--"@
`"But I guess I was just worrying over nothing.@ In the past eight years, you seem to have grown strong.@ I'm relieved, but a little disappointed."@
br
` No, a bit is saying too little.@
` Since I only had the image of the calm Akiha back when she was small, the sharp Akiha right now seems like a different person.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"---Really?@ I'm sorry I didn't meet Nii-san's expectations."@
` Akiha's eyes are scary.@
` …… Crap, I think I may have said too much again.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well then, Nii-san.@ How was life at the Arima residence?"@
` Akiha asks, still with the frightening expression.@
` I feel like I'm under terrible pressure, even though I'm only talking to my younger sister.\

`"Nii-san?@ Did you hear what I said?"@
`"I heard.@ Life at the Arimas', right?@ It was normal, there were no real problems.@ It seems it was more suited for me living there, too."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"That's not what I meant.@ How was your health?@ I have heard you collapsed a lot from your chronic anemia."\

`"Ah, yeah, I did for about a year after I left the hospital, but I'm okay now.@
` I only have problems occasionally, about once a month.@ I'm certainly not frail enough to be worried about."@
` Bluffing, I strike my chest with its scar.@
` Akiha nods in serious assent.\


`"But Nii-san, you've also started wearing glasses.@ After going to the hospital, did your eyesight fail, also?"@
`"……"@
` …… I see.@ Akiha doesn't know I wear glasses or why I wear them.@
` I can't just explain the lines along which things break, or that they don't appear when I wear these glasses.\

`"Well, it's nothing.@ My eyes became a little strange after the accident.@ But it's not like my eyesight's gone bad, so it's not really a serious problem."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Really… I was… well, I was surprised when I saw you a while ago.@ I didn't know you had started wearing glasses, Nii-san."@
`"Really?@ You seemed pretty calm back then."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Of course.@ I was meeting you for the first time in eight years; I couldn't let you see me acting strange."@
` Akiha's brow creases sullenly.\

`"…… Wait, what are you doing back here?@ Weren't you taking a bath with Kohaku-san?"@
`"I forgot to tell you something about the bath.@ Nii-san, the large bathroom we used a long time ago isn't used anymore.@ It would be too much for Hisui and Kohaku to take care of, so it has been closed up."@
`"…… Large bathroom?"@
` Was there such a place?@
` I splutter a bit.@
` Unable to remember, I make a doubtful face.@
` Akiha's brows knit terribly.\

`"The bath in the courtyard.@ You don't even remember that?"@

`"…… But, this is a European-style mansion.@ Isn't such a thing a little out of place?"@

`"Is it true that the curfew here is seven?"@
`"Yes.@ The main gate is locked at seven, and all the entrances to the mansion are to be locked at eight.@
` It is also a rule that one must try not to go walking around in the mansion after ten."\

`"Not even walking around in the mansion?@ …… Well, I've got no complaint with that, but isn't that kind of harsh?@ Akiha and I aren't children, so I don't think you have to go that far."@

` …… Yeah, that vampire thing Arihiko was talking about.@

`"…… To serve… So that's what it is after all."\

` My shoulders suddenly feel heavier.@
` It seemed completely natural to Akiha when she said it, but I'm nothing more than a normal high school student.@
` I have no interest in having a girl close to my age serving me, at least for now.\

`"Yes.@ Please do not hesitate to give me any instructions."@
`"…… Well, I get it.@ Going by how Akiha was talking about you, it doesn't seem like I can dismiss you, so I'll just obediently let you serve me…"@
`"Is there anything in particular you would like?"@
`"Nothing in particular, but could you stop calling me 'Shiki-sama'?@ To be honest, I get chills down my back when I hear it."\

`"But Shiki-sama, you are my master."@
`"That's what I'm saying I hate.@ I've been living a normal life up until yesterday.@ I have no desire to start living a life where a girl my age addresses me with '-sama'."@
`"I see." Hisui's response was less than enthusiastic.\

`"Just call me Shiki, and in exchange, I'll call you Hisui.@ Let's do away with the formalities and be more casual with each other."@
