` On the school grounds, the athletic clubs are holding their practices.@

` Greeting those around me, I take my seat.@
` It's half an hour before homeroom.@
` It's not a bad idea to just watch my classmates arrive.\

` The classroom starts to get busy around seven fifty.@
`"----Huh?"@
` I think I saw Senpai in the hallway.\

`"She's down at the first year hallway again----what is she doing?"@
