` …… It's been about a year since then.@
` There's been a lot that has changed, but the biggest changes were in Akiha and Kohaku-san.@
br
` Simply put, Akiha is still like back then.@
` Her hair is still red, but she dyes it black…… No, it's not like she uses any chemicals, but it seems she can change it with her will.\
` …… She still has the urge to drink blood, so every once in a while she will suck on a blood pack used for transfusions.\

` Akiha absorbed some sort of evil spirit from SHIKI.@
` That's why she originally went on a rampage, but since then, I guess she has control over it.@
` Simply put, it weakened when it transferred to Akiha, and its only influence is making Akiha strong-willed.@
` …… Well, she's more like a bully than strong-willed, but if I tell her that, she will get angry, so I'm not going to.\

` Not only did it make her a bit more honest, but it also increased her power.@
` Thanks to that, Akiha can exert better control over her Tohno blood.@ That's probably why she can hide the color of her hair.@
` …… To say the results, she's pretty much invincible, and as her dear Onii-chan, it's pretty troublesome to keep her under control.\

` ---With regards to Kohaku-san, she became independent after the new year started.@
` Because Akiha is now fine by herself, and maybe because she is planning something, Kohaku-san left to work in a mansion of a branch of the Tohno family in the mountain recesses of Nagano.\

` …… But at the end of the week, she comes back here and the four of us pass the time together like always.@
` Before, I asked her why she decided to do that, and she answered that there was something she wanted to investigate and that I should wait patiently until she is done.@
` Because I love her, I couldn't refuse, so all I can do now is wait.@
` Since then, even though Kohaku-san and I can meet at the end of every week, being alone together is difficult because of Akiha and Hisui.\

` Also, Kohaku-san and Akiha are on very good terms.@
` Kohaku-san likes Akiha, and Akiha cares for Kohaku-san.@

` ……………… *sigh*@

` This picture has to be of that place.\

`"------A place to return to, huh?"@
` Where it is, I do have a feeling without it being said.@
` …… Kohaku-san probably remembered where it was.@
` Those trivial words that Tohno Makihisa said.@ Just working off that information, she must have found that forest.@
` That black forest.@
` Hidden from sight, the old mansion in the heart of the mountains.@

` The place where Nanaya Shiki spent his childhood.\

` ---like that, I fall into a dream.\

` The sunshine that is so white.@
` The smell of the air untainted by the touch of civilization.@
` The endlessly pure sky, the shimmering summer air that rides on the wind.@
br
` The wild grass of spring.@ The starry sky of autumn.@ The cold ground during winter of my home.@
` In summer, it was---the bright flowers that steal your breath away.@
br
` ---There, she is waiting.\

` In front of a sea of flowers.@
` The overwhelming scent of summer.@
` A radiant smile that outshines even those sunflowers.@
` In the midst of the burning heat, she greets me.\

br

br
br
br
br
` ------Welcome back.@
`      This time, it is for real.@
`    As if fulfilling that childhood promise at last.\
