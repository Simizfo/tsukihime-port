` But in exchange, my headaches have gotten much worse.@

` …… I hear a knock at the door.@
` It's probably…… Kohaku-san, I suppose.\

`"-------"@
` Hisui wordlessly performs her usual check-up.@
` Because I haven't slept today, I'm not bleeding.@
` I'm not using an IV, so after taking a few measurements and changing the sheets, she gives me some water and medicine.\

`"-------"@
` The whole time, there is nothing but silence between us.@
` …… After doing what I did, I can't look at her in the face.@
` I think Hisui is like that too, but Hisui probably still dutifully and methodically carries out all her normal tasks because of her role as a servant.\

` And all of a sudden.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t02.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Shiki-sama, how is your body's condition?"@
` She talks to me.@
`"Um, I, uh-----"@
` As far as my condition goes, I can move a little more than before because of what happened earlier, but---

`"Shiki-sama, is there something the matter?@ Your face appears very red."@
`"My, my face is red… because---Hisui, you…"@
`"Yes?@ What did I do?"@
` Hisui tilts her head to the side questioningly.\

`"Uh-----"@
` Damn it, I can't just say it.@
` And I still haven't been able to apologize for before.@
`"That is, I…… I'm sorry about before.@ You must have been embarrassed to do it, but I treated you a bit rough."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t20.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` Hisui lowers her gaze as if embarrassed.@ I suppose she remembers now.@

` ----I guess that's not the reason.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t14.jpg",%type_lshutter_mid
` …… That's odd.@
` Why is Hisui smiling so happily?@
`"…… Hisui.@ Why, are you smiling?"@
`"Shiki-sama, your words and mine were the same.@ I thought it was amusing."@
` Hisui giggles, as if it is really funny.\

` …… My head starts spinning.@
` Hisui's rare smile is so cute, I'm about to go crazy.@

` That might be why.@

`"…… Anyway, I haven't said thanks yet.@ Thank you for before, Hisui.@ …… The, method was a little problematic, but thanks to you my body is better.@ I may even be able to walk a little."@

`"Eh---ah, yes.@ Even though what I did is a small thing, I am happy that I could be of some use."@

` …… Seeing her like that makes me remember what happened, and I start to get a little uncomfortable.\

`"…… But, about before, I don't think it was really appropriate.@ I'm happy, but it's not quite right."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ That's, something that both parties should agree to… and even though you're a servant, you don't have to go that far…"@

` Hisui walks out of the room.\

`"…… She's really calm……"@

` Just seeing Hisui's face makes me blush, but Hisui acted just like she always does.@
`"…………"@
` I don't get it.@
` Something doesn't feel quite right and lingers in the back of my mind.\
