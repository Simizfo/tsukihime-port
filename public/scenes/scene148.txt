` …… I say that, but her pressure is now on a completely different level than before.@
` If I say anything wrong in the face of this frozen heat, she will give a devastating counter.@
` I'll show a calm, reflective manner.@
br
`"---Good morning, Akiha.@ You're up early as usual."@
` I say this quietly and as gently as possible.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t04a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes.@ Thanks to what happened last night, I was unable to sleep at all."@
` She says something so outrageous while still smiling sweetly.@
br
` …… This, really isn't good.@
` She can't be sane, being so angry yet smiling like that.\

`"…… Oh.@ Well, I hope you feel a little better, or something."@
` I should stay away from danger.@
` I have to say something and then escape from here.\

`"Um, then I'll be off to have some breakfast in the dining room."@
` Yup.@ I should retreat to the dining room.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t11a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"----Nii-san."@
` Her voice stops me dead in my tracks.@
` …… Well, of course she wouldn't let me go like that.\

`"…… Yes.@ What is it, Akiha-san?"@
` By the way, adding "san" to her name means waving my white flag.@
` She doesn't even bat an eyelash.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I have something to discuss with you before breakfast.@ Please, sit there on the sofa."@
`"…… Got it.@ Please keep it as short as possible."@
` I plop down on the sofa across from her.@
` Kohaku-san brings me a teacup.@
` Her smile seems to say "Hang in there, okay?" and I'm able to gather up at least a little courage.@
` I drink a mouthful of tea and meet her gaze.\


`"So, what'd you want to talk about, Akiha?"@
`"That woman last night, just what is she to you?"@
br
` ---Guh!@
br
` That was close.@
` Akiha's normally so roundabout, but this time she asks straight on.@
` I'm taken so much by surprise I almost sprayed tea everywhere.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san, did you hear me?"@
`"Yeah, I hear you.@ Loud and clear."@
`"Then please answer.@ That woman from last night, just what is she to you, Nii-san?"@
`"……… Um, that is a troubling question, um, she's a friend, a person I agreed to help---"\

`"A friend so important you had to leave in the middle of the night?@ Yes, I don't intend to have to approve of all the relationships you have, but you are in school now, correct?@

` The eldest son of the Tohno-family, going to places with some strange woman in the middle of the night… please stop doing such shameless things."\

` As she speaks, her cheeks flush and she looks away.@
br
` ---I see, Akiha thinks my relationship with Arcueid is like that.\

`"Wait Akiha.@ There's really nothing between us.@ I'm just helping her find something.@ After that, we won't even see each other again."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh really?@ You certainly seem very close.@ That must be my imagination, right Nii-san?"@
` Her gaze is cold.@
` …… If I lie with something like "That's not it," things will be much easier, but---more than the fact that I don't want to lie to Akiha, I really don't want to say that we aren't close.\

`"----That, may not…… be your imagination, maybe."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Right.@ You were panicking like I've never seen you before.@ You were never serious about anything and now you show all this emotion, just what's gotten into you?"@
`"That's not it.@ I was just totally caught off guard that she'd actually come here."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t18a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"That woman calmly waited for you the whole time, Nii-san."@
` She casts a sideways glare at me.@
` She really seems convinced that Arcueid and I are dating.\

`"Look, Akiha.@ You're getting it completely wrong.@ In the first place, we first met---"@
br
` by me killing her, but I swallow the rest of those words.@
` …… It'll be too stupid to tell the truth.@
` But I can't even think of a good excuse, and I can only stammer.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"If you cannot answer then let's change the question.@ You've been calling that woman "her" this whole time, what is her name?"@
`"…… Um, Arcueid."@
`"I see.@ So you did not meet at school.@ There are no foreign exchange students at your high school."@
`"…… Uh."@
` Like Akiha says, there's no one from overseas at my school.@
` It's right, but why does she know that much?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"So Nii-san, just where in the world did you meet a person like that?"@
`"In the city.@ Just, a coincidence."@
`"Oh, a coincidence?@ Then Arcueid must have talked to you?"@
`"Ah---No, I was the one, who talked to her……"@
` Well, not quite talked, but I was the one that initiated our contact.\

`"Why did you talk to her?@ I thought Arcueid-san was nothing to you.@ Or did you only intend it like that from the beginning?"@
br
` Her questions are right on the mark.@
` Step by step, she draws closer to my secret.@
` Like a snake staring at a frog, she ignores all my excuses and is trying to drive me into a corner.@
br
` I can now only use force to end this conversation.\

`"That's enough.@ I said she's nothing to me!@
` Besides, whatever I do doesn't concern you.@ You don't have any right to complain about who I date, anyway."@
` I point at her directly.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` After giving an angered face---she stands up without a sound.@
`"----?"@
` …… That's odd.@
` I thought she would yell back at me, but instead she appears very uncomfortable and looks away.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Even I, didn't want to say this.@ But it's just, I get a bad feeling from her.@
` If it was anyone else, I would just be resigned to it.@ But, for you to be ensnared by her, doesn't that make me just a big fool?"@
` …… I don't know why.@
` But she regretfully bites her lip as she says these words.\

`"That's why I'm saying she's nothing special.@ What's wrong Akiha, you seem a little strange."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"That's enough.@ If you want to do as you please, then feel free, Nii-san……!"@

` Akiha storms noisily out the lobby.@
`"………?"@
` I don't understand anything at all.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Oh, Shiki-san, that was horrible of you."@
` Kohaku-san gives a disappointed sigh and starts walking after her.@
`"Poor Akiha-sama.@ If you are going to bring your lover, please bring someone more normal.@ If you did that, Akiha-sama would have understood."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid
` Kohaku-san disappears towards the lobby after Akiha.\
