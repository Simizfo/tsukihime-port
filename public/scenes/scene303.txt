`"---No.@ I won't let anyone hurt you.@ Please trust me on that."@
`"…… Yeah, I trust you, Senpai."@
` …… I say that, but being a real small-town person, I'm actually kind of worried about things like my passport and airfare.\

`"But what are we going to do?@ Are we going to the Vatican right now?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, I will treat you for tonight.@ Roa is a vampire, so when it becomes morning, he will calm down.@
` …… It would be simple if it was just a matter of taking you to the Vatican, but your problem is something that should be kept low-profile.@ Just like with me, you are something that should not exist, so you have to go to the hidden part of The Church.@
` But, to take you there, I have to get some permission.@ Even if we were to minimally purify you, there aren't any places in this city where we could do that.@
` There is only one place where we can purify you in our way in this country, so I have to take you there first."\

`"Hmm.@ So, are you saying we're going to The Church tomorrow morning?"@
`"No, it's not that simple.@ For an unbeliever like you to enter the Vatican, there is a long and frustrating approval process.@
` So, tomorrow, I will go to the church in this country so that you can get a temporary permit.\

`"…… And, that may take a number of days, so please wait in my room until then.@ I will place a blockade against vampires in my room, so you should be able to last against Roa for a week or two there."@
`"…… Your room---you mean, I'm staying in your room!?"\


`"…… Um, Tohno-kun.@ Your life is in danger, so please put up with it.@ Oh, you can at least let your sister know, but please don't tell her the details."@

`"…… Well, it's not like I can tell her in the first place---"@
`"Then shall we go?@ We have to separate the Roa inside of you to start off."@

` She grabs my arm and starts to walk.\

` …… There really is no trace of her weakness before.@
` But, it is a forced cheerfulness.@
` Senpai really doesn't want me to be worried, so she's forcing herself.@
`"…… Thanks, Senpai."@
` I speak in a low voice so she won't hear me.\

` Being quite aware that I'm entering a girl's room this late at night, I walk in.\

`"Senpai, so, what do I do now?"@

`"Well, first we will temporarily silence the Roa inside of you, Tohno-kun.@
` …… Well, I say that, but my place itself is holy ground, so the advancement of Roa's consciousness will be greatly slowed just by staying here."@
`"---Oh?@ Then I'm safe as long as I stay here?"\

`"Yes, if we were to just stop Roa's mind from invading yours, this room should be enough, but……"@
`"Hm……?"@
` Her cheeks flushing red, Ciel-senpai hesitates as if she wants to say something more.\

`"…… Senpai?@ What's wrong, is there another problem?"@
`"No, it's not what I would call a problem, but it can be dangerous to your life."\

`"…… Senpai.@ If it's dangerous to my life, wouldn't that be very, very important?"@
`"Well you're right, but um…… If I say directly, Tohno-kun, is there any part of your body that feels strange?"@
`"Feels strange?@ Well, I do have inhuman strength right now."\


`"…… That's not what I mean, but don't you feel like, 'this is really hot!', or like, 'I need to let it out!' or something like that?"@
`"Eh---th, that is---"@
` …… Well, that urge to destroy was certainly in me until recently.@
` And I did that horrible thing to Kohaku-san.\

`"…… No, I'm fine.@ Since I entered this room, I haven't heard that guy's voice once.@ Just like you said, it looks like he'll calm down if I'm in here."@
`"But that is the mental side of your problem, not your body."@
`"---?"@

` She won't listen to me.@
` She drags me to the changing area and forces me to take a shower.@
br
` Of course, by myself.@
` Ciel-senpai is waiting for me in her room.\

`"…… How did this happen?"@
br
` I resign myself to showering.@
` …… As Ciel-senpai said, my body is filthy.@
` There's mud all over my arms and neck and my body reeks of sweat.\

`"I see…… I locked myself in my room since yesterday.@ And it was like I was horny all that time too……"@
br
` ……?@
` Horny, um---that's odd, I'm still standing very erect right now too……?\

`"Huh---huh?"@
` I'm not really excited or anything, so how come---it's so erect down there?\

`"Wait a minute, this is weird---!"@
` It's full of blood ignoring anything I tell it.@
`"----Don't tell me----"@
` Since last night.@
` Urged by Roa's consciousness, since I attacked that woman on the street, I---I've always been like this?\

`"…………"@
` I feel terrified.@
` …… That's bad.@
` I'm supposed to be safe from Roa's will inside of Ciel-senpai's room, but it seems like my body isn't calming down.\

`"…… Hey.@ Staying erect for a long time, um, maybe, isn't that a bad thing?"@
` No, not "maybe", but "definitely".@
` In the first place, being stiff for an hour hurts, so if I stay stiff for an entire day, that's just wrong.\

`"-----I guess I have to?"@
` I speak aloud, and get shocked.@
` So, I've been stiff all day.@
` And since this can't be good, I'm going to whack off in Ciel-senpai's bathroom?@
br
`"I don't---believe it."@
` I can't do such an, embarrassing thing……!@
` This is the bathroom, so if I did something she wouldn't find out, but still, this is too miserable…\

` …… But, being erect for a whole day is seriously bad.@
` I think it was calm after I attacked Kohaku-san, so it hasn't been a whole day, but still---\

`"---Geez!@ Even though I was almost killed by someone I liked until just now, why do I have trouble over such stupid stuff!?"@
` …… Screaming out won't solve anything.@
` I give up and decide to let it out.\

` Hold it in…… it's a little troubling if she says that directly.\

`"Ah……… uh……………"@
` But like Ciel-senpai said, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the fire out of me by myself.@
` In the end, I gave up trying to let it out and left the bathroom.\

`"I'll come out honestly.@ This isn't a situation where embarrassment should stop me.@ As you say Senpai, my body is strange right now.@
` I swear, but I'm not thinking of any perverted things.@ Um, I'm not, but, my body, just by itself, has a hard on and---"@
` I can't really say that I'd rot staying up like that.\

`"See, didn't I tell you to tell me if your body was strange anywhere?"@
`"---!@ Then, you were asking about this before……!?"@
`"Yes.@ Tohno-kun, you may not have realized it yourself, but you are pretty excited.@ I was able to calm your mind, but we have to calm down the body too, or Roa will be able to take over."\

`"I see…… Hey, tell me those kind of things clearly.@ I feel so stupid not even realizing it until I was naked!"@

` ---Oh.@
` That's right.@ Of course she can't say it clearly, because Ciel-senpai is a girl.\

`"Sorry.@ But what should I do?@ I tried to do something about it, but it just won't calm down.@
` It's like my mind and body are two completely separate things.@ My body feels like it's not mine, and I can't even get in the mood for it---"@

` Geez, to say it frankly, it's like I have no sensitivities whatsoever!@

` I see…… Ciel-senpai also had the experience of Roa taking over her body.@
` So she knew this was going to happen to me.\

`"Senpai, then you know what I should do……?"@
`"Of course.@
` …… Um, well.@ Your mind right now is somewhat disconnected from your body.@
` So, more than yourself, um…… someone else's skin, someone else helping you, will make you feel better."@

` So, please don't be so embarrassed."@
`"Ah……… h."@
` After she says it so directly, I don't know how to respond.\

`"Then, Tohno-kun, please wait in the room.@ I also have some preparation to do."@
