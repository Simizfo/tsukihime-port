` ---I don't think death can be a way to save anyone.@
br
` It is an answer I've carried with me since my life was saved eight years ago.@
` No matter how painful or hard it is, I feel happy just being alive.\

` So if I live up to my belief, I cannot kill myself.@
` It's not like Akiha has died either.@
` If she's alive, she might get well again one day if I take care of her.@
` I know that to give away your life that easily means you have an illusion that death is honorable.\

`"------But still."@
br
` Still, I want Akiha to be happy.@
` I just want Akiha to be much happier than I am.@
` Besides,
` I was dead eight years ago and Akiha has given me this dream this whole time.@
br
` So this is just about giving back what used to be hers.@
` There's nothing to be sad about and there's nothing to lose.@
` It's an end where everything goes back to where it came from.\

` The autumn leaves fall.@
` Akiha lies on the red ground.@
` Her hair on the ground is red.@ It flows through the red leaves as if melting in them.@
` Her face looks peaceful, as if she's having a happy dream.\

`"…… Geez, don't catch a cold sleeping in a place like this."@
` I mutter as normally as I can and look down at my body.@
` The "lines" are throughout my body.@
` I look to see which one would kill me the easiest.\

`"…… I have to return what I have borrowed for so long.@ I've borrowed it for too long, but I can still give it back to you in time.@ Right, Akiha?"@
` …… If this body is being kept alive by Akiha,
` then if I am eliminated, the life should go back to its original owner.\

` I place the knife on my body.@
` My heart screams loudly.@
` I am still scared.@
` Since I'm scared, I look at Akiha's sleeping face so that I can go away calmly.\

`"Damn---I just keep on breaking my promises with Akiha."@
` The familiar feeling of death.@
` My knife cuts through the "line" that will kill me the easiest.@
` At that moment,
` as if the thing that controlled my body malfunctioned, my whole body stops working.@

` Hisui exits the room quietly.@
` The room suddenly feels lonely.@
` …… Nii-san did not bring any of his belongings here; there is only a bed and a desk.\

`"………… Really, how could you sleep in such an empty room, Nii-san?"@
` I am surprised.@
` I would have obtained for him anything he wanted, but Nii-san did not ask for anything.@
` …… I guess he was reserving himself a bit, but he was basically a person with no desires for things.@
` He was like that from the time we were small.@
` He said with a smile that he did not want anything and he was happy if we were with him.\

` But that made me uneasy.@
` He did not leave anything and he was not restricted by anything.@
` And he let me know as a child that to be free is to be lonely.@

`"----------Hm?"@

` The view Nii-san was always watching.@
` The forest is illuminated under the blue sky.\

br
` ----After that, I slowly woke.@
br
` In the garden filled with dead leaves.@
` I slowly moved my collapsed body.@
` …… I was still alive.@ My hair was returned to black, and I did not feel the rage in my blood.@
` I was feeling rather well and that load I had always had in my body was lifted, I could almost say it disappeared.\

` Yes, since I was a child.@
` That load that was there since I wished to save my brother, was gone, as if it never existed.@
` …… That load was painful for me, but it was also a load that relieved me.@
` I always had only half of my energy and I always felt a load, but I was happy.@
` Because that load was Nii-san, and I could feel Nii-san as long as I felt the load.\

` But that started to feel really light.@
` I looked around the garden.@
` I could not see Tohno Shiki anywhere in that night of falling leaves.@
` Then, I understood.@
` Why I was able to live.@
` Why Tohno Akiha returned to the original Tohno Akiha.\

`"…… It does… not seem like you would like to join me for some morning tea.@ Is there something you would like to say?"@
`"…… Yes.@ Please forgive my rudeness, but why did you transfer schools again, Akiha-sama?"\

` -----I see.@ It's about that.@
` The fact that I have transferred back to my original school must mean something to Hisui since she does not believe Nii-san has died.\

` This is just like before Nii-san came.@ I only came back on the weekends back then."@
`"That's true, but now that Makihisa-sama is dead, there's no reason for you to come back here, Akiha-sama.@
` You will only come back during long vacations, right?"\

`"-------Yes, I would think so."@
` I nod and feel that I can not hide anything from Kohaku.@
` The only reason I came back to the mansion was because my father wanted me to.@
` Now that Father is dead and I do not have responsibility as the successor until I graduate, there is no reason for me to come back to this mansion.@

` ----I look at the flowing scenery.@

` Are you going to forget everything, Akiha-sama?@
br
` I did not say anything when Hisui asked me that question.@
` Because it's each person's choice.@
` It doesn't matter to me if Hisui does or does not believe in Nii-san's death.@
` Hisui wishes that Nii-san is alive… it's like wishing for a full count, game winning grand slam.@
` …… Seeing that my thoughts are meaningless, I laugh at myself.@
` Because, that is also my wish.\

br
` ---Are you going to forget about Shiki-sama?@
br
` Should I have answered that it will never happen?@
` I know it is impossible for Nii-san to be alive.@
` Because the only way for me to turn back is for Nii-san to give back his life.@
` I know that fact more than anybody----but still, I am believing in him just like Hisui.\

` The load that felt like I had another heart in me.@
` The beating is still there.@
` …… It is really weak and faint, but it is still there.@
` It does not beat and it feels like a rock, but I am certain it is still there.\
