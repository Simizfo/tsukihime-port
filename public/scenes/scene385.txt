`"………… Wrong."@
` Yes, it's probably wrong.@
` It's alright if I can really save Akiha by dying.@
` But there's no proof of that, and besides…
br
` ---I don't think death can be a way to save someone.@
br
` Even if Akiha is saved by my death, how would she feel afterwards?@
` It's fine if she only feels sad about it, but it's wrong if she should feel guilty for the rest of her life.@
` I don't think that choosing death is neither courageous nor honorable.@
` I think---that's just a way to run away from reality.\

`"Aki, ha……"@
` Akiha isn't like the Akiha before.@
` She has become a creature that just kills others.@
` …… But still, I want her to live.@
` If I bear everything for Akiha, who can't feel crime or punishment----I want to believe that Akiha can live.@
`"………… One day."@
` I don't think she'll turn back one day.@
` But to keep my belief in her is the last role for me, as I could not keep her promise.\

`"………… Akiha, even if you're like this forever…"@
br
` I kneel and scoop up Akiha's red hair.@
br
`"…… Just being able to be with you…"@
br
` That will be my greatest happiness.\

`"--------"@
` The autumn leaves fall.@
` Autumn is ending.@
` In this garden filled with many memories, I quietly kiss Akiha.@
br
` ---A ritual with no meaning.@
br
` I faintly see the future.@
` This will be my last time touching Akiha as Tohno Shiki.\

` I open my eyes.@
` Endless blue soaks my sleepy mind.@
` Slightly warm sunlight and a slightly cool breeze.@
` A world with only the smell of grass and the sound of trees.@
` It might be that this mansion's forest is in a different season.@ It's almost winter, but this place still feels like autumn.\

`"----------"@
` I look up at the blue sky as I lie on the ground.@ The sun is already way up in the sky.@
` …… I guess I fell asleep.@
` I guess it was my fault for lying down here on the grass coming after breakfast.@
` Well, I didn't have anything to do anyway.@
` Doing this here.@
` Falling asleep deeply, even forgetting my name, can't be that bad.\

` ----Bottomless blue.@
br
` The clean sky is far away.@
` Thinking like a child, I keep on watching the sky.@
` A far sky like in a dream.@
` The view is so beautiful, I even cannot let out a sigh of amazement.\

`"Shiki-sama……?@ Are you over here, Shiki-sama?"@
` I hear Hisui's voice from the courtyard.@
`"…………"@
` It's that time already.@
` I guess I fell asleep again.@
` If I forgot time while watching this blue sky, it makes no difference if I was sleeping or not.\

` Hisui arrives, composed.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Shiki-sama, Akiha-sama is calling you."@
`"Alright.@ I guess I was asleep.@ Sorry for being so troublesome, Hisui."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t17.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Not at all, it is nothing of the sort ……"@
` Hisui looks down as if she wants to say something.@
` …… I know what Hisui wants to say, but even if she did, I wouldn't be able to give her an answer.\

`"I'll get going.@ Can you tell Kohaku-san in about an hour or so?"@
`"Ah-----"@
` I turn my back to Hisui and head to the detached building where Akiha is waiting.\

` In the room lives a girl.@
` No, the term "lives" is not right.@
` The girl cannot move of her own will.@ She only moves as a living thing when she eats, and she just sits there like a statue when she isn't.@
br
` So instead of "live",
` "exists" is a more correct term, since she is more like a doll.\

`"I'm sorry Akiha.@ I fell asleep and couldn't make it in time."@
` I enter the room and close the shouji.@
` Akiha sits there and does not move.@
`"Whoa, your hair is messed up.@ It looks like you haven't changed yet either.@ Didn't Kohaku-san come by this morning?"@
` Akiha does not say anything.@
` She looks in my direction with a blank stare.@
` …… No,
` it just seems like she's looking.\

`"Alright, let's at least make your hair look good.@
` I touch Akiha's hair.@
` She makes no motion to fight it.@
` Quietly, as softly as I can, I let my hands go through her hair.@
` Her long hair flows in my hand.@
` Akiha does not say anything.@
` After some time like that,
br
` Akiha suddenly moves her arm.\

`"Akiha----?"@
` There's no answer.@
` She just takes my arm and takes it to her mouth.@
` After a hard sensation,
` Akiha bites on my arm and starts to suck out my blood expressionlessly.\

` Her white throat gulps down my blood.\
` The blood which spills out of her mouth drips down her throat and stains her kimono red.\

`"Ghu----u"@
` I grit my teeth and hold on until Akiha is full.@
` …… There is no proper quantity for Akiha.@
` She stops only when she's full, and I can't predict when that is.@
` So all I can do is wait like this for her to be full.@
`"………… Ah."@
` I feel dizzy.@
` But I don't pull back.\

` …… Hisui was against this until the very last minute.@
` I decided to give Akiha my own blood ever since she could only take in human blood.@
` It wasn't a sense of responsibility.@
` If Akiha could only survive by taking in blood, I wanted to limit the amount of victims, and most of all---
` --I didn't want Akiha to drink anyone's blood except mine.@
br
` I guess Akiha really likes my blood.@ She has never gone outside since then.@
` But it is really dangerous for my body too.\

` I do not have much blood to start with, and I am not healthy enough to keep feeding Akiha blood.@
` I faint most of the time when I come here once a day to feed Akiha.@
` Although I'm getting blood from transfusion, it takes my body a while to get used to other people's blood.\

` …… My body is getting weaker by the day.@
` I guess the reason for Hisui trying to say something every time she sees my face is to tell me I should care more about myself.@
br
` But such a thing…
` It's many times easier since I can feel the pain, unlike Akiha.\

` ----Akiha lowers her arm.@
` I guess she's happy now, as she lets go of my arm.\

` Then she goes back to being being a doll once more.@
` I clean the dripping blood off her face and change her dirty kimono.@
` Akiha does not fight back.@ She just accepts everything I do.@
` ---There,
` Akiha's proud look is nowhere to be seen.\

`"---------"@
` I'd be lying if I said this isn't hard on me.@
` But still---my feeling of happiness is greater.@
` Akiha is alive.@
` She is alive and she is here right now.@
` Then, someday, Akiha might return to the previous Akiha she once was.\

`"Alright.@ See you Akiha.@ I'll come back tomorrow so listen to Kohaku-san at night."@
` I say the same phrase as yesterday, no… the same phrase as always, as I hold Akiha's hands.\

` Slender fingers, small hands.@
` I cover them in my hands.@
` The warmth.@
` The fact that she is alive.@
` It almost makes me cry.\

`"…………………!!"@
` I suppress that feeling and smile.@
` I want to laugh so that I won't have room for any sadness.@
` It's easy to feel sad about the situation I'm in.@
` Even if Akiha doesn't understand, I have to keep on smiling in front of her.\

` One day, if Akiha ever finds herself again, I don't want her to remember how I was sad.@
` I want her to think that this was nothing----that this was one of the happy times too.@
` So I have to keep on laughing.@
` Even if Akiha doesn't understand right now, so that Akiha wouldn't regret the past when she finds herself again.\

` ---I keep on waiting, holding her hands.@
br
` Even if Akiha's eyes are not staring at anything, I will keep smiling until the end of the world.@
br
` So that one day, when Akiha wakes up,
` I would be able to greet her like it was another normal day and say "Hi".\
