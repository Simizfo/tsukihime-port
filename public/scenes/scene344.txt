` I start to breathe heavily.@
` I press my hand over my mouth and resist the urge to throw up.@
`"Wh-----"@
` What, was that?@
` A dream.@ It was a dream.@ But, what was that?@
` Why did I have such a terrible dream, of killing people and drinking their blood?\

` I try and catch my breath.@
` The thirst in my throat.@
` The feeling of biting flesh.@
` The pleasure burning through my brain as I killed.@
` …… These things, why do they seem so real?@
` I can even remember perfectly the feel and sound of the heart as it was ripped out.\

` I continue to gasp hungrily for air.@
` I don't know if it was really "pleasure".@
` It was just excitement condensed like a bullet, fired straight into my head.@
`"Guh…"@
` My breath stops as I remember.@
` Then---perhaps that impact could be something called "pleasure".\

`"Why did I… that kind of dream…"@
` I look down at my hands.@
` Of course, they are pure white, without a trace of red blood on them.@
` I am sleeping on the bed, and fresh morning sunlight shines in through the window.@

` …… That time.@ That first meeting with the vampire Yumizuka in a back alley… is it still in my mind?@
` Maybe that's why I had such a ghastly dream.\

`"Ow----"@
` My neck hurts where Yumizuka bit it.@

` ---Those who are bitten by a vampire become vampires as well.@
` Unexpectedly, that common phrase pops into my head.@
