`"Ga----!?"@
` My head pounds.@
`"Agh---ah, agh………!"@
` I can't, remember.@
` When I try to remember about yesterday, I feel the urge to vomit.\

` I'm scared.@
` I'm scared of the fact that I can't remember.@
` It feels like…
` A Tohno Shiki I don't know is killing people, and in order to hide it, is deceiving the Tohno Shiki that is me.@
br
` ----And.@
` I sense someone in the hallway.@
br
`"Who's there----!?"@
` I call out.\

` Knock.@ Knock.@

` "Please excuse me," Hisui says as she enters the room.@
` It's just a normal morning scene.@
`"Ah---------"@
` Is it because she is acting so naturally?@
` My pounding heart instantly calms down.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."@
`"……… Hisu, i?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, it is time, so I have prepared your change of clothes already.@ …… Um, Shiki-sama?@ Are you not feeling well?"@
`"No, that's not it.@ I feel fine.@ There's nothing wrong."@
` I get up from bed, as if to prove my words.\

`"Morning, Hisui.@ I'll go to the sitting room after I change, so please go ahead of me."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ Well then, please excuse me."@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` Hisui quietly closes the door and leaves.@
` After watching her go, I take a deep breath.\

`"Why am I feeling down like this?"@
` Probably because I found out about my old man's illness yesterday.@
` Just because my symptoms are similar to his, maybe I'm being too paranoid.@
`"…… Yeah.@ Ever since I came back, I've been so tired.@ I shouldn't think about that dream."@
br
` ---Well then.@
` It's almost seven.@
` Like yesterday, I should be able to enjoy the morning.\

` ----And then…
` Unthinkingly, I step into the sitting room and it hits me that I forgot something very important.@
`"Oh cra-----"@
` I swallow my words.\

` Akiha, Hisui, and Kohaku-san are in the sitting room.@
` Everything seems just like normal, but after what happened yesterday, I'm sure it'll be really awkward.@
` Akiha and Kohaku-san seemed to have reached an understanding, but I haven't spoken with Akiha yet.@
` Thinking how Akiha acted yesterday, I'm pretty sure Akiha's still mad at me.\

`"Good morning, Nii-san.@ Did you sleep well?"@
`"--------Huh?"@
` And.@
` Akiha greets me with a big smile.\

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

`"Uh………………?"@
` My mind freezes at such an unexpected event.@
` Akiha still has a big smile as I just stand there.@
` Akiha is way too cheerful and it makes me think she is planning something.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Shiki-sama, would you care to sit down?"@
`"Ah…… yeah, if you want me to sit, I will."@
` I fearfully look at Akiha as I sit down across from her.@

`"Morning, Akiha.@ You seem to be in a good mood today."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t08a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Is that so?@ Certainly I feel much better, so I probably look less pale than before."@
` …… No, it is far beyond not looking pale.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Anyway, first I have to thank you.@ I really wanted to thank you yesterday, but I was feeling rather ill and did not have an opportunity."@
` Akiha looks directly at me.@
` There isn't even a trace of yesterday's coldness.@
` …… It also seems that the air of danger has disappeared.\

`"Thank me?@ I didn't really do anything to deserve that."@
`"That's not true.@ You took care of me when I was sick, right?@
` Because you embraced me, I was determined.@ I was extremely happy that night."@
`"-------!"@
` She says something that catches me totally off guard.@

` ----And then.@
` I feel incredibly heavy pressure against my back.\

` I glance behind me.@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

` …… There, Hisui and Kohaku-san stare at me in a manner far different than usual.\

`"---Akiha.@ Don't say things that might give people the wrong impression.@ You were in so much pain, I just supported you, that's all."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t08a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Oh?@ I suppose wrapping your arms around me is just supporting me?"@
` Akiha giggles softly.@
` Staring.@ They're staring at me.@
` The stares of the two behind me get even heavier.\

`"---Now look.@ You're acting odd.@ Are you enjoying making fun of me?"@
`"Yes, a lot.@ Looking at your troubled face is fun."@
`"……………"@
` This is just too weird.@ Is this really Akiha's personality?\

`"You have some strange hobbies.@ Bothering me in the morning and lecturing me last night.@
` …… Well, I thought so at first, but you really must have something against me."@
` I end with a sigh.@

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` All of a sudden, Akiha averts her gaze.\

`"…… I'm very sorry.@ What I did yesterday was stupid.@ There was something wrong with me, and I've already apologized to Kohaku---"@
`"You apologized to Kohaku-san!?"@
` I blurt this out in surprise.@ Not only did she apologize, but she apologized to Kohaku-san.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"---Hey.@ Nii-san, just what kind of person do you think I am?@ I was at fault, so it is only natural that I apologized to Kohaku, right?"@
` …… When she says that, I get a vague mental image of her acting as a strict mistress.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nii-san.@ You're thinking of something bad, aren't you?"@
` …… She's sharp.@ As happy as she is, it doesn't do anything to dull her sense of perception.\
