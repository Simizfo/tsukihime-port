` …… I guess I'll go take a look in the tea ceremony room.@
` I'm sure Senpai said something yesterday after class about having lunch there.@
` If Senpai is there, maybe I can talk with her while having lunch.@
br
` ---Most importantly,
` I enjoy having lunch with Senpai, and I'm also worried about the news story from this morning.@
br
`"---Alright."@
` Gotta strike while the iron's hot and all.@
` I head off to the tea ceremony room before Arihiko notices my plan.\

` I knock on the tea ceremony room door.@
` After a brief wait, the door creaks open and Senpai pokes out her head.@

`"Huh?@ Tohno-kun?"@
` Puzzled, Senpai tilts her head.@
` She doesn't seem annoyed, but it seems like she really doesn't understand why I came here.\

`"Would you like to have lunch together, Senpai?"@
` Holding out the bread I purchased at the cafeteria, I tell her why I am here.@

`"Lunch?@ I'm happy to hear you ask me, but---"@
` Senpai thinks over it looking troubled.@
` …… Things don't look good.@
` It seems Senpai isn't very interested.@
` I guess I've got no choice.@ I decide to employ a little strategy.\

`"I have curry bread."@

`"Eh---?"@
` Senpai's face becomes bright and cheerful.@
` …… I had a feeling about this from yesterday's lunch, but I am amused at her reaction.@
`"I'll give you this in thanks for yesterday's lunch, so why don't we eat together?"@

`"Yes, please!@ I've just put the tea on!"@

` Senpai hastily vanishes inside.@
` Following her, I enter the tea ceremony room.\

`"Ah……"@
` As I enter, it becomes obvious why Senpai was hesitating back then.@
` On top of the tatami mat is an already empty lunchbox.@
` It seems like Senpai has long since finished eating her lunch.\

`"Tohno-kun, would you like green or English tea?"@
`"Eh?@ …… Ah, green tea, please.@ More importantly, have you already finished lunch, Senpai?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes, just a little while ago.@ I slept in this morning, so I didn't have any breakfast and I was hungry all morning.@ It was terrible!"@
`"…… I see.@ Well, you don't have to force yourself to accompany me.@ Sorry for intruding on you.@ I'll eat in the classroom, so please take your time relaxing."@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Eh---?@ You mean you're not going to give me any bread?"@
` Senpai's sorrow seems to resound from the bottom of her heart.\

`"No, I mean---you must be full, right, Senpai?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Not at all.@ I'm hungry."@
` …… It doesn't appear she's just saying this to make me feel better.@
`"Really?@ Well, I'll be intruding then… Is this really okay with you, Senpai?@ The bread from our cafeteria really has volume, you know."\

`"No need to worry!@ If it's food I like, then I can eat limitless amounts of it."@
` That bashful smile is most probably not from shyness, but from anticipation of the curry bread.@
`"………"@
` …… She is a woman of many mysteries.@
` Someone who could be so happy over one curry bread in this day and age could be quite precious…\

` Senpai eats one while I have two, and we have tea afterwards.@
` Kneeling on top of the mat, Senpai and I casually sip our tea.@
` It would have been great if it wasn't during lunchtime at school, but that's life.\

`"How is your new house, Tohno-kun?@ It seems something terrible happened this morning."@
`"Hmm… yeah.@ Well, the inside of the house is really fancy, but there are these really noisy stray dogs at night.@ I guess it's also bad that there's no TV and no Japanese-style rooms, so there's nowhere to drink tea like this."@
`"What, a stray dog?@ You mean what happened at your house wasn't related to those serial killings?"\

`"I don't really know.@ There's this really high wall all the way around our mansion, and they say they found bloodstains there.@ But listen, that's where---"@
br
` ---I saw the stray dog last night.@
` I couldn't say it.@
br
`"…… Hmm.@ Well, anyhow, it's got nothing to do with us.@ Let's stop talking about unpleasant topics, now that we've finally got an opportunity to relax."@
`"Not at all!@ We're residents of this town, so I think the killings do have something to do with us."\

` Holding her cup in one hand, Senpai casts a serious gaze towards me.@
`"Yeah, I guess that's true, but you'll be okay if you don't go walking in the streets late at night, won't you?@ There's been eight people killed so far already, right?@ With that many victims, the police ought to catch the guy any day now."@
`"---Geez, Shiki-kun!@ You don't have any sense of danger, do you?@ The newscasters have been saying the same thing since the third victim was found, but they haven't caught him yet, have they!?"\

`"Hmm… Well, that's true.@ It's just that I can't really relate to it when they give it such a stupid caption like 'The Modern-Day Vampire'.@ I'm sorry, I really did take it too lightly.@ We live in this town, so we've got to be careful, right?"@
`"Yes.@ I'm glad you understand."@
` Senpai smiles in a satisfied manner.\

`"But Senpai, why are they calling him a vampire anyway?"@
`"Well, the blood was drained from all the bodies, right?@ Isn't that kind of like a vampire?"@
`"…… You really think so?@ Isn't it said that you become a vampire yourself once a vampire sucks your blood?@ These victims are all dead, with the corpses to prove it, so they don't really have to go calling him a vampire."@
` Senpai laughs and nods.@
`"Do you really believe in things like vampires, Tohno-kun?"\

`"…… Hey now, I'm just saying that's how the news is presenting it.@ If there really were vampires, there wouldn't be any dead bodies left, just like I said earlier."@
`"Yes, you're right.@ But can't you think of it like this?@ The people who were found dead died because they couldn't become vampires.@ There are actually people who can and can't become vampires, and those who can become vampires wouldn't show up as dead bodies after being attacked by one.@ Because they're still alive somewhere."\

`"Haha, that's what you'd call a horror story, Senpai."@
`"Yes, exactly.@ I'm sorry to say there's no punch line."@
` Laughing, Senpai sips from her cup.@
br
` While we are having our rambling conversation, lunchtime ends.\
