` Even Akiha and the others wouldn't be able to sleep with a racket like this.@
` Since I'm the only man in the house, I guess I've got no choice but to go investigate.\
`"…… I think it's coming from the right side of the mansion."@
` I open the curtains and check what's happening outside.@
br
` ---And,
br
` outside my room is a large tree.@
` On one of the branches is perched a blue crow.\

` In the dark night,
` I can see nothing but black, and yet it's quite clear to me that the crow is blue.@
`"…………"@
` I've never seen or even heard of a blue crow before.@
br
` It glares at me.@
br
` It feels like the eyes of the crow are staring at me, like soulless, mechanical lenses.\

br
` Kwaaw!@
br
` After a yawn-like cry, it noiselessly flies off.@

`"…… What was that?"@
` …… I can feel a faint chill on my back.@
` The howling of the dogs grows louder.\

` Awoooooooo.@
`            Awoooooooo.@
`                       Awoooooooo.@
br
`"…………"@
` It's really starting to get on my nerves.@
` Not only is it noisy, but hearing it causes my heart to start pounding.@ I have an almost instinctual distaste for it.@
br
`"Shut---up!"@
` I change out of my pajamas into my uniform, and leave the room.\

br
` Awoooooooo.@
br
` The howling echoes through the night.@
` That sound is definitely coming from the right-hand side of the mansion.\

`"…………"@
` For some reason, my throat feels dry.@
` The high walls stretch their way around the mansion.@
` Clearing my throat, I head towards where the dogs must be gathered.\

` I arrive at where the howling originates.@
`"…… Huh?"@
br
` Awoooooooo.@
br
` The howling doesn't stop.@
` But there are no signs of any dogs.@
` All there is---is a person.@
` Under the light from the streetlight that carves apart the darkness stands a man in a dark coat.@
br
` The howling is coming from right beside him.@
` ------But there are no dogs to be seen anywhere.\

` The man in the coat is pretty tall.@
` He has a strongly built body, and his back is facing me.@
`"---------"@
br
` My throat… so dry.@
` Awoooooooo.@ The voice of the dog resounds in my ears.@
` The night air coils itself around my skin.@
br
` For no apparent reason, I have difficulty breathing and moving, as if I'm at the bottom of the sea---\

` Kwaah!@
br
` A cry overhead.@
` With a loud flapping of its wings, the blue crow lands onto the man's shoulder.@
br
` ---Then,
br
` suddenly, the crow vanishes.\

`"…… Eh?"@
` Can it be an illusion?@
` It looked like the crow disappeared into his black coat.@
br
`"------"@
br
` The man in the black coat turns around.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\nero_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` Under the white streetlight, he is just like a shadow.\

` A black lump.@
` In the middle of that lump, only the weapon-like eyes shine out, burning with a fiery intelligence.@
br
`"…… Ah."@
br
` I can't breathe.@
` But fortunately, those eyes seem like they're not even looking at me.\

` The man in the black coat leaves.\

` When I can no longer see him, I am finally able to breathe properly again.@
`"Hhahh---haah, ah."@
` I manage to take a few breaths.@
br
` I realize the dogs' howling has ceased.\

` I return to my room.@
` There is no sign of Akiha or the others being awake.@ I guess I'm the only one who couldn't stand the dogs' howling.\
br
`"------Guh!"@
br
` What's happening?@
` My head still hurts.\

`"Huh… ?@ Why am I trembling?"@
` Looking down, my fingers are trembling.@
` My entire body is shaking, and my back feels very cold.@
br
` It's almost like… yes.@

` It's like someone ripped out my spine and replaced it with ice.\

` I get the feeling of falling towards the floor.@

` On the way, I see something unpleasant.\

`"Wha---!?"@
` Even though I'm wearing my glasses, I can still see the "lines".@
`"Uuh……!"@
` I hadn't seen them at all for a long time, so my reaction is magnified.@
` I feel sick.@
` With the dizziness from my anemia, I feel like I'm about to throw up the contents of my stomach.\

`"…… What's, going on?"@
` I don't understand.@
` Only that as long as my eyes are open, scribbles fly everywhere across my vision.\
br
` ---It's a bad… dream.@
br
` Somehow, I manage to collapse into bed.@
` …… Yes.@ I should sleep.@ That's the easiest way to deny what I'm seeing.\

` My body doesn't move as I want it to.@
` All I should do is lie here and fall fast asleep, like a corpse---\
