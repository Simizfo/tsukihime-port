` Well, it is difficult to talk about it, so let's just leave it aside."\

` -----I don't understand.@ Then what does that trash want to make me do?@
br
`"That's what I've been saying.@ I'm warning you not to wake up.@ You, I mean Tohno Shiki's reality is nothing more than spending the rest of your life in a coma.@ If you awake to that, you won't even be able to dream.@ Even though you could manage your body, your brain would not function.\

`"In other words, death.@ Not death to your existence, but the death of your will.@ In that situation…… you wouldn't need to die, right?@ Even if you woke up, you can't live in reality.@ I'd be much happier if you just watched a dream about reality here."@

` Such as getting older, having a person you like, living busily every day."\

br
` ----…… No.@
` Wouldn't we be the only ones becoming happy there, Shiki?\

`"………… You are stupid.@ It's simple to be happy by yourself.@ If you start to think about others, it gets much more difficult.@

` And in reality, you and I never did anything wrong.@ But this is how we ended up, right?@
