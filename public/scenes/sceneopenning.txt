` -------Suddenly, I awaken with a start.\

br
br
br
br
br
`                   The night is pitch black.@
`               And no one else is in the house.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
`                It's scary, being alone in the dark.@
`              So to find everyone, I head out into the garden.\

br
br
br
`                Our mansion's gardens are vast fields of green.@
`              Surrounded by a thick, dense forest.@
`                With the trees blanketing out the light,
`               almost like a massive curtain.\

br
br
br
br
br
`              Like a stage in a theater somewhere.@
`              The curtain of trees opens with a swishing sound.@
`                             Excitement fills me, 
`               anticipating the beginning of the grand play.\

br
br
br
br
br
`               In the distance, I hear the sound of echoes,
`               beyond the black curtain of trees.@
`                           Inside the forest,
`             the sounds of everyone happily playing around.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
`                 The curtain doesn't open yet.@
`                    Unable to restrain myself, 
`              I wander into the darkness of the forest.\

br
br
br
br
`                           Darkness surrounds me… 
`                      A blackness so deep, it's suffocating…
`   Not even the calming rays of the moonlight can reach this deep.\


br
br
br
br
br
`                          The air is cold…
`                     A winter's chill so deep,
`                  my eyes feel like they'll freeze.\

br
br
br
br
br
`          For a brief moment, I thought I heard someone call my name,
`                so I walk even deeper into the forest.\
br
br
br
br
br
`                 After passing through the veil of trees,
`           I find everyone waiting for me in the forest clearing.@
`                           But, something is wrong… 
`                          Everyone is lying on the ground…
`               …… Everyone is lying on the ground…… in pieces…\
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`                   The clearing is bathed in red.\

br
br
br
` ---I don't understand.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` A stranger approaches.@ 
`                 The look on his face says he wants to rip me apart…\

br
br
br
br
br
` ---I don't understand at all…\


br
br
br
br
br
br
`      But, someone else, someone I don't know… steps in front of me,
`                               and is torn apart in my place.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---I'm just a kid, so, I really don't understand.@

br
br
br
br
br
`                  A splash.@
`               Something warm and wet hits my face.@
`                   It's red…
`               A red liquid, red like a tomato.\

br
br
br
br
br
`                The person that was torn apart,
`               that person I called "mom",
`             never called my name again.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` -----I really don't understand.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
`                  But it is just so cruel…
`             I wanted to cry, I just felt like crying.\

br
br
`                    Warm crimson blurs my vision.@
`                     Seeping into my eyes.@
`                     But it doesn't bother me at all.@
`                  The lonely moon floats above me,
`                        bearing witness in the night sky.\

`                  It's strange.@
`            Why didn't I realize until now?\

br
` ---Such a cold, horrible nightmare.\


br

`              Yes---I didn't realize it.\
