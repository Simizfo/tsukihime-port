` I stop walking.@
` I stare at the crouching SHIKI as I stand on the slimy ground.\

`"Ha-----haha, ahahahahahaha!!"@
` SHIKI is laughing loudly.@
` …… I know.@ If I stop now, he will recover from his wounds.@
` I know I have thrown away my last chance.@
` But still----if there's a way to get Akiha back, I have to hear it.\

`"…… Really?"@
`"What?@ I can't hear you."@
`"…… Is it for real, SHIKI?"@
`"Yeah, I talk a lot but it's against my policy to ever lie.@ So I'll tell you if you stay there a bit longer---and depending on your attitude, I could go ahead and save Akiha myself."\

`"…………… Save, Akiha…………?"@
` Is it that I felt something bad in those words?@
` My body shakes and I almost fall.@
` The ground is slippery because it's slimy------

` ------Wait.@
` I am now…\

`"Well, you should know how to save her.@ She has no power to live as a human, so she has to live as a Tohno.@
` And since she is using the power of the Tohno blood, she became one of the Tohno blood, rather than someone of human blood."@

` His weapon made out of red blood…\

`"So if you reset things back to the state where she can live as a human, she doesn't have to rely on the Tohno blood.@
` See?@ Isn't it easy?@ If you want to save Akiha, all you have to do is eliminate the cause for her current state."@

` The blood that was flowing from SHIKI's body…

` How could I be so careless?@
` If that red sword was made of his blood, then it would be easy for him to make his flowing blood into swords as well.\

` Grunting with exertion, I jump from the puddle of blood and roll onto the ground.@
` …… But I couldn't get away unscathed.@
` My left arm is useless now.@
` My left arm wasn't stabbed, but cut from the inside out.@
` …… In other words…
` The blood I wiped off with this arm cut through through me like an exploding firework.\

`"Agh------gh………!!"@
` I roll on the ground and fight the pain.@
` I still got lucky.@ If I hadn't of wiped that blood off my chest, I would have grown swords out of my back and died instantly.\

`"Shit------!!"@
` I hear a voice.@
` The sound of SHIKI running toward me through the grass accompanies it.@
`"You don't know when to stay down.@ You should have died with that-----!!"@
` He's coming.@
` I cannot fight back since I'm on the ground.\

` He's coming.\
` He sticks out his arm with sharp nails and approaches, trying to dig my heart out.\
