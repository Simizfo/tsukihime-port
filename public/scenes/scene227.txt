` ---I won't.@

`"…… Mm, I'll pass.@ Do what you want."@
` Seeing a vision of food with something red on it isn't something I want to do again.@
` To be honest, I'm already feeling bad looking at Arihiko's sandwich.@
` Because there are many bright red tomatoes in it.\

`"What's this?@ You're becoming more and more unhealthy.@ Is your new lifestyle not suiting you that much?"@
`"That might be it.@
` They complain about me being late when I wake up at seven o'clock and the curfew's at eight o'clock.@ If I spend the night somewhere without asking, they interrogate me afterwards.@ It's like a prison, right?"@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Isn't that alright?@ It's a proper life.@ Early to bed and early to rise, right?@ You won't be able to grow up to be a good guy if you burn out when you're young."@
`"I agree.@ …… But, you seem to lend the argument more strength than anyone else can."@
br
` As the ultimate counter-example, that is.\

`"Oh yeah?@ You're pretty honest today.@ Alright, alright, I'll split the sandwich with you."@
`"I said, I didn't want to eat.@ Don't worry about me and eat; lunch'll end soon."@
`"Okay, down the hatch."@
` Arihiko holds his sandwich with both hands and begins to eat.@

`"Hello everyone."@
` Senpai comes in with something that looks like a boxed lunch.\


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Oh?@ Senpai, I thought you always ate in the cafeteria?"@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"No, I don't have a set lunch routine.@ It just depends what mood I'm in."@
` Senpai takes out an boxed lunch wrapped up in a cute handkerchief.@ But it seems just a little too big for a girl.@


`"…… You mean you managed to get up early and make lunch this morning?"@
`"Yes, that's it.@ I managed to wake up before seven this morning and…… wait a minute, what are you making me say, Tohno-kun!?"@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"…… No, that's not what I meant, but…… Senpai, you're not a morning person?"\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Eh----?@ Ah, yes, I'm not… not good at waking up early."@
` Senpai suddenly looks like a student being scolded by a teacher.@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"My family owned a bakery, so we'd get up very early every morning.@
` But I'm terrible in the morning.@ My father would always get angry when I was a kid."\

` What!?@ A bakery!?@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


` Me and Arihiko look at each other.@
` He must be imagining the same thing I am: Ciel-senpai kneading dough with those white fingers of hers and baking it.\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"My daily battle with my father lasted ten years, but in the end, he gave up and told me working two people's worth is better than trying to train me.@
` Since then, I can wake up when I want to."@
br
` Ciel-senpai sticks out her well-developed chest.@
br
`"Oh, is that so?@ I'm a little surprised; you seem so reliable."@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Yes, I always try hard to not make any mistakes in front of you.@ But really, I'm more of a clumsy person."\

` Yeah, maybe she is a bit clumsy.@
` Come to think of it, I really started to get close to Senpai when I saw her, an upperclassman, all alone in the courtyard fixing those splints and helped her out.@
` A really clumsy person would never do something that wouldn't benefit them the least bit.\

`"I see.@ ---But, I like people that are clumsy.@ I can relax better with them."@
` "Yup." Arihiko agrees next to me.@
`"So, since you're not a morning person, you usually eat in the cafeteria?"@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Yes, although I usually eat in the cafeteria, there are times when I make lunch.@ Aren't you two part of the cafeteria group?"@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Nah, it depends on what mood we're in too.@ When we were freshmen, my sister made me something, but Tohno here would always eat in the cafeteria or buy bread, so I end up doing what he does."\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"I see.@ So Tohno-kun is a person of many moods."@


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Yeah, yeah.@ Being with him will just drain you out, so be careful Senpai."@

` "That's true," Senpai agrees and she opens her lunch.@
` The round box is half rice and half side dish.@ It's pretty much a normal lunch, but it seems a little large.\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Then, I'll start eating.@ Is it okay if I use this person's chair?"@
`"A person who isn't here has their chair up for grabs.@ I'm sure Takada-kun would love for you to have his seat, Senpai."@
` Takada-kun is a guy who sits next to me.@ He's pretty plump, but a good guy.@
` Sometimes, he borrows money with a grace period which lasts about until the end of eternity.@

` Senpai doesn't put her lunch on my desk, but puts it in her lap.@
` Next to her, Arihiko starts opening his second pack of bread while still standing up.@
` Next to these two, I stare aimlessly out the window.\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Huh?@ Tohno-kun, are you not eating?"@
`"No, I thought I'd skip today."@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Not eating…… Won't that make you hungry?"@
`"No, not really.@ I'm not hungry and skipping lunch doesn't affect me that much."@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Wow, that's amazing.@ If I skip a single meal, I can't function.@ I'd just collapse of hunger.@
` …… It's a little embarrassing, I always eat more than most people, and I still get hungry."\


ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Not at all.@ Senpai, you've developed a lot more than other women.@ I'm sure you have to eat a lot to maintain that large chest of yours."@
` Yeah, Arihiko speaks the truth.@
` To tell the truth, we both want her to eat more and grow more.@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t11.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


` Is Senpai embarrassed or shy?@ She makes a face I don't quite understand.@
` …… Well, I'm sure she's probably happy.\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"But Tohno-kun, will you really be alright if you skip lunch?"@
`"I'll be fine.@ Skipping meals during the day isn't that rare.@ I only didn't eat breakfast, so I'll probably be fine until evening."@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Wow---Tohno-kun, your body will break down with that kind of lifestyle."@
`"It won't break.@ This is more of a mental restriction.@ …… Well, thanks to an accident long ago, my doctor told me it wasn't good to gain weight, so it's better for me to skip meals once in a while."\


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Huh.@ I guess even guys still think about their diet after all."@
` Senpai looks up at me for some reason, and after thinking a little bit, closes her lunch.@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Um, I just remembered I had something to do, so excuse me."@
` Gathering up her things quickly, she disappears like the wind.@


cl l,%type_lshutter_fst


`"---Mmm, how cute."@
` Arihiko comments on Senpai regretfully while watching her leave.\
