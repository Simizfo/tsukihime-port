` As a result, Kohaku-san was saved.@
` I fell into a condition where my eyes would not function in addition to the decrease in my physical body strength.@

` …… Well, I somehow understood that I went blind.@ When I stabbed my knife into her body, the only thing I was able to see were those "lines".@
` So when I was told I went blind, it didn't shock me that much, but then, my sight came back shortly after.\

` The examination revealed absolutely nothing wrong with my eyes, but only problems with my nerves.@ Rather than my cut nerves connecting themselves, it seems that it's more like the nerves which were numb healed up.@
` …… It seems like my eyes will not go blind that easily.@
` Or it might be that even if I do go blind, I'll still see those "lines".\

` Kohaku-san was no longer the Kohaku-san from before.@
` …… No, that's not quite right.@
` The system of the brain can be divided into four functions: recording, preserving, playback, and recognition.@ And it seems that Kohaku-san has something wrong with her preserving function.\

` The doctor said that she can return to her normal lifestyle, but…… she can't remember most of her past.@
` …… It isn't so much that she can't remember, rather, it is more like she lost it.@
` The preservation of her memories up until now---all that information was lost, so there is nothing to remember.@
` So Kohaku-san cannot remember me or Hisui.@
` …… Having Kohaku-san return to the way she was before really is a hopeless dream.\

` I don't know if it was the near-fatal shock from the poison or if Kohaku-san closed it off herself.@
` But, I know that the Kohaku-san has the body and heart she had before, but she has forgotten all about me, Hisui, and Akiha.\
