` The hardest thing for me was to find a reason to move.@ A doll can't move by itself.@ Without a spring or strings, it can't act like a human.@
` So, once I found a reason, everything became simple.@

` All I needed to do was to place mistrust between them by making SHIKI-sama reject Makihisa-sama.@
` SHIKI-sama said that he wanted to drink blood, so I gave him mine and told him that he wasn't a bad person and I kept him the way he was."\

`"When SHIKI-sama became sick, I took care to make special medicine for him.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` In simple terms, it's a drug that makes people hallucinate.@
` Once they are unconscious, they listen to what I tell them, and when they wake up, they don't remember a thing.@ Quite convenient, don't you think?@
` Because I was educated to become Makihisa-sama's personal doctor, I know a lot about these sorts of things."\

`"With things like that, SHIKI-sama went crazy at my convenience.@
` After that, it was even easier.@
` I secretly told Akiha-sama to look inside Makihisa-sama's room around midnight, and she finally found out about our relationship.@
` Since then, Akiha-sama felt guilty and it became easier to do a lot of things."\

`"Well, I didn't expect her to protest against him right away though.@ But because Akiha-sama pressed the issue, I was released from Makihisa-sama soon after.@
` …… I thought that I wouldn't be free until SHIKI-sama killed Makihisa-sama, but I was freed four years earlier, actually.@
` From then on, I became a normal servant and traded places with Hisui, who became silent.@

`"I just remembered something.@
` …… It was when I was a child.@
` I was scared and hurt, but more scared of dying.@
` Tohno Makihisa was huge, like a demon out of a story book.@
` The mansion was too big, like a haunted house.@
` Every day was cold, and it was my daily routine to cry and scream.@
` But if I raised my voice, it got worse, so I had to endure it all."\

` She was laughing under the sun by easily jumping out the window of the haunted house, where I could not get out, no matter how much I wished for it.@
` …… Come to think of it, everything was sad.@
` That's why.@
` That's why I wanted to become a doll that didn't feel pain."\

` If I did that, there would be no more pain, right?"\

`"Wha……………………"@
` I can't say anything.@
` A girl who thought she was a doll.@
` A girl who couldn't live without thinking that she was a doll.@
` Kohaku had no other means of salvation but to maintain an illusion that she really was a doll.\
