`"---Good morning."@
br
` …… I hear an unfamiliar voice.\
` The dream quickly fades away as a voice calls me back to reality.\

`"It is morning.@ Time to wake up, Shiki-sama."@
br
` An unfamiliar voice greets me.@
` …… Stop calling me Shiki-sama already.@
` I told you yesterday, it sends chills down my back----\

` ---I wake up.@
` Hisui stands far from the bed, like a statue.@
`"Mm……"@
` I sleepily look around.@

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."@
` A girl in a maid uniform bows.@
` For a moment, I doubt my eyes.@ Finally, I recall my current condition.\

`"Yeah, I came home, right…"@
` I push myself up, and look around the room.@

` Outside the window, the weather is great.@
` A blue sky like the one I saw in my dream.@
`"Good morning, Hisui.@ Thanks for coming to wake me."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"There is no need to thank me.@ It is my duty to come and wake you, Shiki-sama."@
` Hisui answers indifferently, completely expressionless.\

` *sigh*@
`"…… Why do you have to be so formal, Hisui?"@
` It's really a shame.@
` If Hisui only had half of Kohaku's brightness, she would be really cute.@
`"---Do you need something?"@
` Realizing I am looking at her, Hisui stares straight back at me.\

`"Ah, no, nothing at all.@ Waking up and seeing your face, I just felt like I'm really at the Tohno mansion…"@
` Hisui's eyes are like cold ice.@
` Seeing that all of a sudden, something reminiscent of a dream flashes through my mind---
`"-----I, see."@
` I remember it completely.@
` That day, that girl who gave me the ribbon right before I left was the one who always watched us from that window.@
` That is, in other words---
`"It was…… Hisui."\

`"Yes?@ Did you say something, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Ah…… Hisui, do you remember?@ About when I left here eight years ago?"@
`"Yes, I remember it.@ But, was there anything special that happened?"@
`"Eh---anything special?@ Hisui?"@
`"Please forgive me.@ Eight years has passed since you departed this mansion.@ So even if you speak of those times, I cannot answer with any specific details."@
`"Wha-----"@
` Does she not remember the promise we made back then?\

`"Hisui---you don't remember about the ribbon?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Ribbon……?"@
` She looks downcast as she admits with difficulty that she does not remember.@
`"…… I see.@ That's right, it was eight years ago…… Sorry, it's nothing.@ Just forget about what I said."@

`"……………………"\

` …… She doesn't remember the promise.@
` But, it isn't anything I can hold against her.@
` Even though it was maybe just a childish promise, it really did help me to face forward into the future back then.\

`"Well, time to get up.@ Hisui, do you know what time it is?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, it is now past seven o'clock in the morning."@
`"Okay, that leaves me just a little time then."@
` Stretching my back, I get up out of bed.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t23.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"You say that, but you do not have much time.@ It takes about thirty minutes to go from the mansion to your school.@ You only have twenty minutes to eat breakfast and get ready."@
`"Eh----that's right, this isn't Arimas' house!"@
` I'm filled with horror.@
` I was so used to the Arima house being only twenty minutes away from school, but from here, I don't even know a shortcut.\

`"Your uniform is folded and awaits you over there.@ Please come to the sitting room after you have changed."@

`"Damn it, if you're going to wake me, wake me up earlier…"@
` Muttering selfishly to myself, I reach for the uniform.@
` It's folded neatly, and the shirt has even been ironed.@
` Passing my wrists through the sleeves feels good.@ It's that fresh, brand-new feeling.\

` They are drinking tea together gracefully, as if breakfast ended a long time ago.\
