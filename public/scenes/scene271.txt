` Where Hisui headed to, there seems to be a small clearing.\

`"……… There's a clearing there……?"@
` Tilting my head to the side, I try to remember, but for some reason, my memory is a bit vague.@
` In the forest of the mansion, I can see a clearing as if the trees were cut there.\

` ---No, "can see" is not quite right.@
` If you walked by normally, you probably would never notice it.@
` If Hisui didn't walk there, hidden enough by the surrounding trees as it is, I would never have noticed even if I lived here all my life.\
