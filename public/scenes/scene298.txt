`"…… I told you before, Tohno-kun.@ Roa has requirements for the family he decides to reincarnate into.@
` If you think the other way around, you just have to look for families with those traits.@ When you know that, finding him is very simple.@
` It's easy to find families that have special abilities passed down through their blood once you do a bit of research.@ In this city, there is only one family that fits Roa's requirements.@
` So---I knew from the beginning who Roa was."\

`"-----Wha--"@
` That's strange.@

` Wait.@
` I just want, her to, wait.\

`"But, a little mistake happened.@
` …… I was watching you from afar so as not to stimulate Roa inside you, but I concluded that you might not be Roa's new reincarnated host.@
` But, the eldest son of the Tohno family had to be what Roa reincarnates into.@ There is no mistake in that, so what had to be a mistake was you, Tohno-kun."@
` Ciel-senpai speaks matter-of-factly.@
` I---can't say anything.\

`"Looking into it, you were fatally wounded eight years ago and adopted by your relatives.@
` What happened afterwards was exactly as Tohno SHIKI said two nights ago.@
` I don't know what happened in the Tohno family eight years ago, but you were killed by that kid called SHIKI.@ No, it's more like your life was stolen.@
` As a result, you became connected to SHIKI who was Roa's host."\

` A direct voice, without emotion.@
` I don't know this Ciel-senpai.@
` Or is this…
` Is this the true Ciel, and the kind person I knew up until now was all just----\

`"Up until now, there should have been times where Roa's memory would flow into you through SHIKI.@
` He is a vampire that manipulated the shapeless thing called a soul.@ For Roa, you two who shared one life were a finely crafted double existence.\

`"That's why---when SHIKI's body was destroyed, Roa didn't need to reincarnate.@ He still had a place to run to: you."@
` Cold.@
` As if hating her enemy, she detests me.\

`"But, it's all over now.@ I wasn't prepared to finish it so suddenly that one night, but tonight is different.@
` I really am fortunate in a way.@ If Arcueid had destroyed Roa, he probably would have reincarnated again."@
` …… I can't.@ Believe this.@
` That---that…
`"----That's not, true."\

`"Go ahead, please keep on denying it and play dumb.@ That makes my job easier.@ Still---"@
br
` A metallic rattle sounds from the weapon.@
br
`"It doesn't change the fact that I can finish you off easily no matter what you do, Roa."\

`"-------"@
` Her laughing voice causes me to finally understand.@
` …… She isn't lying.@
` …… Her eyes aren't looking at "me".\
` …… Her feelings never did have anything to do with "me" from the beginning.\

`"…… What is this?@
` Then, then from the very beginning, you always thought of me as Roa?@
` Senpai.@ Being friends with me was all just……………!"@
br
` ---I can't say it.@
` I can't finish the sentence.@
` If I do that, I feel like everything will turn into a lie in that instant.\

`"Of course.@ After SHIKI was destroyed, the only reason why I stayed in school was because Roa had not disappeared.@ Since Roa is a student here, it's more convenient for me to stay."\
br
` I would never go back while leaving you here.@
br
` That's what she told me once with a smile.@
` That wasn't, for my sake.@
` She stayed here just to search for the still-living Roa.@ That is the only reason why she gave me her phone number.\
