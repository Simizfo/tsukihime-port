` With just lightly jumping back,
` I increase the distance between us to many meters.\

`"Eh-----?"@
` The one who's surprised is me.@
` Weapon still at the ready, Senpai pursues me emotionlessly.@ "----!"@
` I run towards the school's front gate.@
` My body is almost frighteningly light.@
` I run as if slicing through the wind.@
br
` Even if Senpai's athletic abilities far exceed those of a human's, she can't chase me if I'm like this----\

` ----And then.@
br
` My body stops suddenly.@
` No matter how much I try to move forward, my legs won't budge.\

`"-----Wha--"@
` When I turn around, there is a sword pierced right there.@
` A thin, nail-like sword is pierced into the ground at my feet.@
` The sword is piercing my shadow, which seems to be the reason why I can't raise my legs from the ground.\

`"Why…… you……!"@
` I gather up all the strength in my legs.@
` But no matter how hard I try, they don't even move one millimeter.@
br
` ---And there.@

` The member of the Burial Agency nicknamed "Bow" appears.\

`"Sen---pai."@

`"---Farewell.@ At least, with this---"@
` She speaks in a small voice, almost inaudible.@ She plants the point of the weapon against my heart and pulls the trigger.@
br
` A brief explosion.\

`"G---hu."@
` I cough up blood.@
` After a flash of light that seems to blow apart my brain,
` inside my disappearing self, I see my soul, being scattered away, like the pages, of an old book.\
