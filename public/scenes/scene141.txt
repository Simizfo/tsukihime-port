`"Arcueid, it doesn't concern you, so leave me alone."@
` I look away from her and refuse.@
` But Arcueid keeps saying "Come on, come on," over and over.\

`"Come on, tell me.@ You can at least tell me who you dreamed about."@
` She asks like a curious kid.@
` Every time I turn away she keeps jumping in front of me, saying "Come on, come on."\

`"…… Please, just let it go.@ There was something wrong with that dream.@ …… Even now, that---"@
` I don't know why I saw that dream.@
` Arcueid says it's my greatest desire, but I don't want to think that's what it was.\

`"Oh, maybe it turned into a nightmare?@ She does tend to write the story to her liking when fond of her target.@ She's only a novice, so I guess it couldn't be helped."@
` Arcueid mumbles to herself.\

`"……?@ Writes the story to her liking?@ What do you mean?"@
`"I'm saying she interprets your desire in her own way.@ That dream familiar I sent you is just a child, so she likes to play pranks."@
`"----I see."@
` …… That's a relief.@
` That's right, that dream---It couldn't have been what I wanted.\

` I let out a sigh of relief.@
` With this, my innocence has been proved but---
`"Arcueid.@ Why did you send me such a thing?@ That's too much even for harassment."@

`"Hmph.@ I wouldn't harass you.@
` I sent you the dream familiar to thank you for defeating Nrvnqsr.@ I really am grateful to you, so I thought it'll be great if it made you happy."\

`"Thank me?---Well, I'm happy you were grateful, but…"@
` But no matter what, I'll pass on that sort of thanks.@

`"…… That's…… true but."@
` Arcueid slumps her shoulders.@
` …… How do I say this… Arcueid is very open in expressing her emotions.\

` Being happy, being angry, she changes her expressions so quickly---It's actually kind of charming.@
br
` …… I said she was a vampire, but,
` she really does seem like a human, enough to even make me forget that fact.\

`"…… In the first place, why did you send me that dream familiar thing?@ Are you still angry at me for killing you?"\

`"That's not it at all.@ I sent it as thanks for defeating Nrvnqsr.@ I really am grateful to you, I thought you'd be extremely happy."@
`"As thanks?---I'll pass on that kind of thanks.@ Having that kind of poor taste, just what are vampires thinking?"@
` I slump my shoulders.@
` I don't know what she's mad about, but she looks at me with a dissatisfied expression.@

`"…………"@

`"…………"@
` Maybe I did say too much.@
` No matter what the results were or the methods used, she really thanked me with good intentions.@ I start to feel intense regret and think that maybe I should have just accepted her gift happily.\
