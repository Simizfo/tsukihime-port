` …… It is a little selfish, but I'd better ask Kohaku-san to make me something to eat.\

`"Ah, Shiki-san.@ You're back."@
` Moving the broom off to one side, Kohaku-san bows.@
`"Yeah, I'm back.@ I do have a little favor to ask, though."@

`"Yes?@ Is there something special you need?"@
`"Um, I'm a little embarrassed, but…"@
` Before I could even ask her nicely to make me something to eat,
br
` the growling of my stomach rumbles through the courtyard.\

`"------"@
` Surprised, Kohaku-san just gapes.@
`"-----Uh."@
` My face turns red… I didn't realize my body was that crass…
`"…… Um, so that's it.@ I didn't have much to eat since morning, so I can't wait until dinner…"@
`"------"@
` Kohaku-san stares at me wordlessly and then, as if remembering, lets out a little laugh.\

`"I understand.@ So you want me to fix you something light?@ Shiki-san, is there something you want in particular?"@
`"Something I want?"@
` …… To be honest, I was just hungry, and I didn't even think about what I wanted to eat.\

`"Um…… I guess some pancakes would be fine."@
` I don't know why, but the image of golden pancakes just pops into my head.@

`"Pancakes……?@ Shiki-san, I've heard that you do not like sweets, but…"@
` Kohaku-san tilts her head in surprise.@
`"Ah---no, I don't eat a lot of sugar, but it's not like I don't like it… I did eat lots of Japanese candy at the Arima's too…"\

`"Really!?@ If that was the case, you should have told me earlier.@
` I was wondering all this time if I should get you something during teatime.@
` But from now on, I'll make you the same thing that I make Akiha-sama."@
` Kohaku-san's voice suddenly brightens.@
` …… But eating the same thing as Akiha, does she mean I'll be eating those dainty little shortcakes from now on…?\

`"But, Shiki-san, why do you want pancakes?@ If you want, I can fix you something a little better."@
`"Hm…… no reason, I guess.@ I like them because they are pretty simple."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t18.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ahaha, Shiki-san, you just said the same thing as Hisui-chan.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` This is a secret, but I think Hisui-chan really likes pancakes, too.@ Whenever she tries to cook something, it's almost always pancakes."\

`"Really?@ …… That's pretty surprising.@ I thought she would like something a little more complex."@
` Like, a very decorated cake that makes you wonder where to cut it from.@
`"Isn't it?@ I think it is a little strange too, so I asked her.@ She told me it's because I told her that they are very simple to make.@
` But she says she still can't make it to satisfy her…"@
`"……………?"@
` …… Um, so it's not that she likes pancakes, but just that she practices making them?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, sorry Shiki-san.@ I will go make you some, so please wait in the sitting room."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` With her broom in hand, Kohaku-san hurries toward the rear entrance.@
`"-----Well, whatever."@
` In any case, I'll get to eat soon.@
` I'll be able to have some tea and pancakes and then get to rest until dinner----\
