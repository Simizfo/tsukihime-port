` I don't want that and I pull her closer to me.\

`"Nn…… ah."@
` Pulling her in, I seek out her lips.@
`"Ha…… n, n……!"@
` Hisui resists slightly as she might be having a hard time breathing.@
`"------Ha--ah."@
` But I can't stop.@
` Her breath.@ Her lips.@ Her warmth.@ It all feels so good.\

` With my eyes still closed, I slip my tongue in between her lips.@
`"N--n!"@
` Unlike before, now she really tries to pull back.@
` I embrace her body to hold on to her, and I continue to seek out her tongue.\

`"A…… n, n……!"@
` If I open my eyes, I bet I'll see her distressed face.@
` If I saw that, I'd let her go right away.@
` And so, instead,
` I continue blindly twirling my tongue against hers.\

`"N…… a, a……"@
` Our wet tongues intertwine.@
` Just the sensation of my tongue against another's drives me wild.@
` Just the fact that my sensitive tongue is feeling someone else's tongue makes my rational thought about to explode.@
br
` And because it is Hisui's tongue, it crumbles completely away.\

`"A…… n, n…… ah……"@
` The red, tangled tongues continue their dance.@
` Even though our lips separate, our tongues have become one.@
` …… This isn't just some sort of metaphor.@
` Our tongues are stuck together with all our saliva.\

` ---I wonder how long that lasted?@

` Before I know it, my body is burning, and Hisui is at the side of the bed adjusting her clothes.\

`"…………"@
` Hisui looks at me apologetically.@
` …… Seeing that kind of face makes me feel sorry.@
` After making her go through all that pain only to make it useless, it's completely my fault.\

`"…… But, What should we do?@ Um…… do we have to give it one more try?"@
`"……… Yes.@ If it is, what you wish."@
` Hisui's voice almost disappears.@
br
` ---If I wish so?@ Of course I wish so.@
br
` Even though I just came, my penis is still fully erect.@
` In all honesty, that was not enough.\

`"I'm okay with it.@ But are you?@ If it still hurts, we can wait a little bit---"@
`"…… No, I am fine.@ But please, before your body reaches its limit, please pour yourself into me."@
` …… Hisui… Even though she seems to be so tired she can't even talk steadily, she still insists on doing this.@
` Hisui is really pushing herself.@
` She is probably still hurting, and she must be tired.@
` …… I can't forcefully make love to her like that.\

`"…… I understand.@ Then, come a little closer."@
`"Eh---ah………"@
` Holding her arms, I sweep her on top of me.@
`"Ah…… Shiki…… sama."@
` She must be incredibly tired, because she just rests herself completely on me.@
`"Yes…… please, do as you wish, Shiki-sama."@
` Taking a deep breath, she puts her body right on mine.\

`"…… Hisui.@ This is fine, please raise your hips a bit.@ You don't even have to move.@ I'll go slow."@
` Hisui wordlessly agrees.@
` Her hips inch upwards.@
` Still wet from last time, I place my erect manhood against her.\

` …… A sliding touch.@
` I don't enter, but just rub her gently.@
`"Nnn………"@
` Hisui breathes sweetly.@
` Her body is tense.@
` She readies herself for it to enter her again.\

` Sliding, sliding.@
` Slowly, I rub against her teasingly.@
`"A…… n, …… Na………… Ah."@
` She moans.@
` Her breathing swirls down my chest.\

` …… Slide, …… Slide, …… Slide.@

`"Ha………… Nnngu…… n, Ha----"@
` As I rub her with my shaft, her breathing heightens.@
` Calmly, our bodies meet like puppies licking and greeting each other.@
` The sound of our wet flesh meeting becomes louder and more frequent.\

`"A…… Ha…… Ahh, a……… nn."@
` I feel like I'm rubbing against the sweetest jam in existence.@
`"N…… Shiki…… sama, I, I……"@
` Her voice sounds even more passionate than before.@
` Back and forth, up and down.@
` Her love juices flow between us, coating us with sticky passion.\

`"…… Nnnn……… ha--ah…………… Ha."@
` When I notice, I realize my hips aren't the only ones moving.@
` It really is a small movement.@
` As if trying to relieve an itch, Hisui rubs herself against me.@
`"Nnn----Hisu, Hisui--"@
` The rubbing causes a thrill of pleasure to shoot through me.\

`"Hisui, m…… more."@
` I can't resist, and I grab her hips.@
`"N--"@
` Hisui stops suddenly.@
` I revel in the feeling.@
` I grip just a little stronger and feel her firmness.@
`"Ah--Shiki-sama, right---there---"@
`"…… I see.@ That was just a little break."@
` I let my power out.@
` Her hips start to move again and she breathes out in short, sweet sighs again.\

` The sweet sliding friction.@
` I continue sliding in between her cheeks.@
`"…… Hisui.@ Could you use more of your body……?"@
`"Eh…… yes.@ Like, this……?"@
` Slide, slide-slide.@
` She slides all the way down, meeting my hips.@
`"Mmm--yeah, that feels--great."@
` Hisui slowly and sensuously raises her hips.@
`"Ah…… stuck, feels……"@
` Did I catch on something?@ The movement stops for an instant.@
` But, no big deal.@ Hisui smoothly moves up again.\

`"Haa…… This, is great."@
` This really gets me excited.@
` It isn't even doing much, so why---why does it feel so good, and why does it make Hisui look so adorable?@
`"N…… ha, Ah----Ah."@
` Hisui can't stop herself from voicing her passion.@
` Moving her hips up and down, she leans the rest of her body on mine.\

`"…… Hisui…… does it feel good……?"@
`"Y…… s.@ Yes…… Shiki-sama, your chest…… is broad, I feel…… so relaxed---"@
` Exhaling, she presses herself even more against me.@
` I continue to revel in the rubbing her sliding cheeks give me.\

`"----Tss."@
` My heart rate increases even more.@
` …… This gentle foreplay starts to overwhelm me.@
` Hisui isn't the only one feeling the pleasure.@
`"Ha----"@
` I tense the muscles below my groin.@
` It's to stop the urge rising from my very core.\

` Even though I'm just rubbing against her, it's as close to the real thing as it'll be.@
` No, knowing that I'm rubbing her outside numbs my mind and brings me more pleasure than the real thing.@
br
` Our bodies are clenched together.@
` The sensation of her breasts pushing up against my chest is so wonderfully soft.\

` No, the feeling of her small, delicate body just resting on mine is even better.@
` Our voices rise in harmony with the pistoning of our bodies.@
` Hisui relaxes completely, moving only her hips.@
` Her beautiful back, the sensuous curves of her bottom, all of it---I love all of it.\

`"Hisui---can I?"@
`"Eh…… are you, stopping already……?"@
` Hisui must've really enjoyed it because she regretfully plays her fingers on my chest.@
`"We don't have a choice.@ I have to do it inside of you, so we have to do it right."@
`"Ah…… yes, that is right…"@
` Hisui slowly moves her body.@
` As she moves to pull back, she gets down on all fours, like a cat.\

`"----"@
` Her posture jumps out at me.@
`"Hisui, don't move."@
`"Eh……?@ But Shiki-sama, we cannot…… do it, like this, right?"@
`"It's okay, just lift your hips a little.@ No, not with your hands---get on your knees and elbows."@
`"……?"@
` Confused, Hisui tilts her head to the side, but complies.\

` ----All set.@
` Since Hisui's well rested, I won't hold back.@
` To let out all that's been welled up inside me, I get behind her and---\

` ---I enter her from behind.@
br
`"Nku----!?"@
` The bed rocks.@
`"Ah---n, nku----"@
` Hisui drops her back.@
` Her toes curl up as if resisting the shock.\

` Seeing her completely from this angle, her body seems entirely different.@
` Her long, white, graceful legs.@
` The single curve of her unblemished back is like a field of virgin snow.@
` It's so white and pure, I get the urge to bury my face in it.\

`"…… Wow.@ I can even see your asshole and… right here… completely."@
`"Shi, Shiki-sama--please, don't say things like that……!"@
` Hisui blushes and shakes her head.@
` But Hisui can't turn her body because I am in her now.\

`"If I do exactly the same old thing, it'll be boring.@ I think you're already used to it too, so we'll do it this way this time."@
`"Ha…… Shiki-sama, why is it that you are only mean, now……!?"@
`"………… Tch."@

`"Ha, oh, oh, n…… Ah, n---!"@
` Her body shakes every time I thrust into her.@
`"…… Nn, nah, ha--Ah!"@

`"Then, it's over, right……?@ I'm sorry, hurting you twice like this."@
`"…… Not at all.@ If I could help you, then I am satisfied."@
` Hisui says this as she lies there, staring blankly.@
` Her eyes aren't even focusing on anything.@
` …… Is that what they call absence of mind?@
` It seems Hisui simply lies there without any rational thought.@
` But her eyes still hold tears, and I feel a stabbing pain in my heart.\

`"…… I'm sorry, Hisui.@ I've made you cry so much."@

` …… That's right.@ Before, it was just to help me recover--that's all it was from the beginning.@

` Sweat glistens in rivulets down her body.@
`"…… Um…… Shiki-sama.@ What---should…… I--do now?"@

`"…… I'm moving, Hisui……!"@
`"Ah…… N, no, please stop……!"@
` Ignoring her, I lift her up and bring her down.@
`"N, ha……!@ Ah, Aah, HaAaAAA……!"@
` Her fingers clench as her senses are overwhelmed.@

` ~ Month ~ Day
` My son SHIKI succumbed to his Tohno blood.@
` SHIKI, he killed my adopted son who happened to be there.@
` (The adopted son is the heir of the house Nanaya. I guess it is a blessing in all the unfortunate events that he isn't in the same family as the Synchronizers, like Kohaku and Hisui.)
br
` SHIKI's inversion impulse is terrible.@ So it was determined that he must be eliminated.@ I have my duty as the head of the Tohno household, but killing my own son is so difficult.\

` The Tohno blood, more in SHIKI than in AKIHA.@
` Talking about potential, I feel an older origin in Akiha's blood, but SHIKI's Tohno blood runs much stronger.@
` I assume that is why SHIKI inverted before he became an adult.@
` SHIKI's powers are "immortality" and "fusion".@
` SHIKI could not manage the awakened powers and as a result, killed the adopted Nanaya child, taking his life.@
` I have to say it was a superb job for using his powers for the first time.\

` ~ Month x Day
` Both SHIKI and the adopted son managed to escape death.@
` Before I killed SHIKI, he killed the adopted son and stole his "life", regenerating himself with it.@
` I don't know if it is because he was so close to death, but SHIKI has regained some of his sanity.@
` Even though it is dangerous, I will not kill him but simply separate him from the mansion for a while.\

` On the other hand, the adopted child of Nanaya will not live long even if he does survive.@
` Even if he does heal, his life has been taken by SHIKI.@ His body can die any day.@
` As long as the adopted child lives, there is a possibility that his mind will be attuned with SHIKI's.@ It seems it is a side effect of their two lives being linked.@ But if that happens, the adopted son will die eventually, so there is no problem there.\

` ~ Month ~ Day
` The problem of maintaining appearances to normal society still remains.@
` SHIKI has killed the adopted Nanaya child.@
` I have covered up the incident, but SHIKI cannot be shown to the public.@ The wound I gave him hasn't healed and his figure has transformed.@
` He is not in a condition to be brought in front of others as Tohno SHIKI…… he cannot be called a human either.@
br
` The Nanaya child still lives.@
` As long as he lives, I've decided to use him.@
` If there are any disagreements, I would like to hear them.\

` Complementarity.@
` The Nanayas are a family that produces killers.@
` If that adopted son happens to stay alive, the link between him and SHIKI may corrupt SHIKI's mind.@
` Even if SHIKI regains his sanity, I cannot deny the possibility of the Nanaya child's influence turning him into a killer.@
br
` To not let this happen, we must have him somewhere where we can keep an eye on him.@ But we cannot allow him near the Tohno mansion either.@
` I should have him raised by an appropriate branch of the family.\


` ~ Month x Day
` …… The Tohno blood that has awakened within SHIKI.@
` Maybe it is because he was so close to death, but he has regained his sanity like before.@
` But I don't know if something will cause him to invert again.@
` Even though it tears me apart, I cannot allow SHIKI near the Tohno mansion either.@
` I place him in the care of a trusted servant.\

` ~ Month x Day
` I still haven't received word that his sanity has completely been restored.@
` …… A year has passed with him under the care of another house.@
` My heart is in anguish.@ It is so hard for me when I think of the way my own son has to live.@ As soon as SHIKI heals, I will be able to bring him back to the mansion.\

` As I arrive on the fourth floor, that sound screeches once more.@
` It's close.@ It feels like it is in the hallway past these stairs.@
`"Akiha----!!"@
` The worst mental image still writhing in my brain, I dash into the hallway.\

` ----Eh?@

` For a moment, I stand, dumbstruck.@
`"-------"@
` From behind me, I hear Hisui gasp.@
`"A----Aki… ha."@
` That's the only thing that pops into my head.\

` The Moonlit hallway.@
` In the freezing air that cuts into my lungs,
` Akiha is standing, a few yards down the hall.@

` Like blood, a deep crimson.@
br
` ---At first, it looks like Akiha's blood.@
br
` But that's not right.@
` What is red is just her long, long hair.\

`"------"@
` I'm still not able to grasp what is going on.@
` Down the hallway, there is Akiha, with her red flowing hair and---

` him, crouching with one hand on the floor, coughing up blood.\

` The one kneeling before Akiha is him---SHIKI.@
` Akiha is looking down at him.@
` …… Drawing close behind her is the figure of Kohaku-san.\

cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

` SHIKI is seemingly on the verge of death and gasping for air.@ Akiha is not even breathing wildly.@
br
` ---The situation.@
` Unbelievably, it would seem Akiha is the one overwhelming him.\


`"Gu………!"@
` SHIKI leaps forward.@
` In a flash of speed I can't even follow, a black blur shoots toward Akiha.@

br
` Skreeeeeeeee!@
br
` Akiha simply glances down at SHIKI.@
` With that, his body slams down to the ground, and as if in response to the sound.@ His torso burns, giving out smoke.\

`"Hya--aaAaaaaaAH!"@
` SHIKI's screams echo through the hallway.@
` His evaporating body is covered in smoke.@
` His body under his kimono has mostly bones showing, like a mummy.@
` But he still lives, his gruesome form still staring at Akiha.@ His eyes filled with fear.@
` On the other hand, Akiha's clothes are undisturbed.@
` …… Even from here, I can understand it all.@
` Her surroundings are distorted like a heat-induced mirage, and it seems more out of this world than the air in the building.\

`"Haa, g, uwaaaaaa………!"@
` SHIKI claws at his evaporating body.@


ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t27.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

` Akiha calmly observes without carelessness.@
br
` ----These two's powers…
`    They are fundamentally different.\

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

`"Amazing…… Akiha-sama, that is…… amazing."@
` Behind me, Hisui speaks in surprise.@
` That's exactly what I'm thinking too.@
` …… What is this?@ You can say she is superior, but that's too much.@
` She is too overwhelming----\
