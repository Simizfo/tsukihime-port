` Even though she was in so much pain, she's not the kind of person to rest because of it.@
` She told me to go back.@ In other words, she was saying she won't be going back.@
` I think she plans on finding the vampire by herself.\

` Then----I'll go to the shopping district and find the vampire or The Dead before she does.@
` Arcueid can't find them, but I can spot The Dead if I take off my glasses.@
br
`"------Alright."@
` Taking off my glasses and grimacing from the slight headache, I run to the shopping district.\

`"Damn it----still, I'm not finding anything."@
` …… All the people walking through the shopping district have normal "lines" on them.@
` I don't see anyone painted with the disjointed scribbles I saw before.\

` As long as I have my glasses off, this headache will only get worse.@

` In a narrow alley between two buildings, I can see something like sparks flying in the air.@
` No, more accurately,

` If----I run away here, she might go off and die.@
` I can't shake off that feeling, and I enter the alley filled with death.\

` A dull, sickening sound.@
` The last one, the last human shape full of lines expires from her hands.@

` She smashes the head of The Dead into the wall, squishing it like a tomato.@
` As if not satisfied, she tears the headless body vertically in half and smashes it onto the ground.\
