` I see.@
` This impulse.@
` This impulse that tries to drive me insane while leaving me conscious.@
br
` This is,
` This is Roa.\

` But why?@ I was always sane.@
` Until I came back to this mansion, I really was normal.@
br
` I hear heavy knocking on the door.@
` But I can't open it.@
` If I open it, it will be completely over.\

`"Ah-----"@
` I finally understand.@
` That dream was the memory of the Roa one generation before mine.@
` Locked up in her room, killing both her parents, ruling over her town as a vampire, the final memories of someone I don't know.\

`"------"@
` …… There's no way out.@
` This is not a problem that can be solved by killing myself.@
` This is nothing that can be helped.\

` I understand that previous person's feelings.@
` Even if I die, the only thing to die would be my will.@ Then the will of Roa would take over my body completely.@
` If that happened---things would get much worse.@
br
`"Ha---haha, ha."@
` …… In the first place, I don't have the slightest intention of killing myself.\

`"Shiki-sama, please open up, Shiki-sama!"@
` I hear her voice from behind the door.@
br
` …… It almost sounds like it was in another language.\
` So far away.@
` Just one.@ It's just one sheet of wood between us.@
br
` But it seems as far away as the moon and the stars.\
