`"------Alright."@
` I've decided what to do from the very beginning.@
` Taking the knife out of my pocket, I walk up to the door.@

`"----Shiki?"@
`"I'm going to go check things out.@ Don't leave this room until I come back."@
` I step out into the hallway, shaking off Arcueid's look that she wants to say something.\

` No one is in the hallway.@
` …… I couldn't hear from inside, but the hallway is noisy.@
` It's not that this floor is noisy.@
` Rather, the noise is coming from beneath my feet.@
` There is some kind of ruckus on the floor below; I can hear the noise of many people talking.@
br
` …… That's odd.@
` It's just past four in the morning.@
` Even under the assumption some people have woken up early, it's not normal for this many people to be up at this hour.\

`"……… Doesn't look strange so far."@
` I walk down the hallway.@
br
` The noise from downstairs is like the sound of ocean waves.@
br
` Noisy--and yet so very solitary and inactive.\

`"------!"@
` My fingers gripping the knife feel numb.@
` A chill runs over the back of my neck.@
` There's something near my temple.@
` Pain emerges from the back of my eyes.@
br
` Enduring it, I walk down the hallway.\

`"------"@
` It… hurts.@
` My eyes… hurt.@
` My head grows heavy, and I feel a drifting sensation, like I'm about to collapse right here.@
br
` Yeah, I know what this is.@ This is the feeling I get right before I collapse from anemia.\

`"Ah----gu………!"@
br
` It hurts.@
` It hurts.@ Unable to withstand it any longer, I remove my glasses.\

` …… There are two elevators.@
` One is stopped on the first floor, the other on the fifth.@
`"………"@
` There is an unpleasant feeling in the air.@
` A suffocating, tense sensation.@
` I push the button to call the elevator.@
` I just want to know what's going on downstairs for now.\

` The elevator rises.@
` …… Sixth floor.@
!w500

` …………… Seventh floor.@
!w1000

` ………………………… Eighth floor.@
!w1500

` ……………………………………… Ninth floor.\

`"--Damn it, what's up with it?"@
` The elevator is awfully slow.@
` Something--a shapeless, shadow-like premonition of something fatally irrevocable clings to me--
br
` ………………………… Tenth floor.@
br
` Just one more floor until the elevator reaches this one.\

`"------Hurry up."@
` My breath catches.@
` I realize all the noise I heard from below is now long gone.@

` With a ridiculous electronic 'ding', the elevator arrives.@
` The door opens.@
` There is no one inside.@
` The interior of the narrow steel box is surprisingly clean and tidy.\

`"------"@
` I enter, and press the button for the tenth floor.@
` With a heavy noise, the elevator descends.@
` Just one floor down, but it feels awfully far.@
` The current floor display shifts to show the tenth floor.@
`"Finally--"@
br
` Suddenly---

` The world is engulfed in darkness.\

waveloop se1

`"………!?"@
br
` Darkness.@ Total darkness.@
` Pitch black, utterly without light.@
br
` In that,
` all I can see is the faint glimmer of the 'lines' of death.\

`"Why--?"@
` My breath freezes in my throat.@
` From all around, something--some kind of rustling sound, like the sound of insects crawling around--can be heard.\

br
br
` *rustle*@
br
br
` *rustle* *rustle*@
br
br
` *rustle* *rustle* *rustle* *rustle* ……!\

`"-----!"@
` I am about to cry out, but I hold back my scream.@
`"…… First, I've got to examine the situation…"@
` Just like Sensei taught me long ago.@
`"…… And then, think carefully…"@
` Taking a huge breath, I manage to calm my thoughts.\

`"…… I see…… A blackout."@
` …… But a hotel like this should have a backup generator for occasions like this.@
` Something must be wrong with the cables, if even that's not working.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` *rustle* *rustle* *rustllllllle*\

`"……!"@
` Gripping the knife, I tense up.@
` The sound of the crawling insects is coming from around the elevator.@
` It's like…
` It feels like there are hundreds of giant cockroaches clinging to the outside of the elevator.\

`"--There's no point in staying here."@
` The display stopped when the tenth floor was lit.@
` Then it means that if I open the door, I should be at the tenth floor.@
`"----Guess I'll cut it."@
` I whisper to myself.@
` Thrusting the knife into the only 'line' I can see, I cut apart the door of the elevator.\

`"…… !?"@
` The instant the door opens--I am enveloped by a suffocating stench.@
` The tenth floor is filled with it.@
` It's so thick just breathing it is enough to clog my airways.\

`"-----"@
` But even so, if I were to take a step outside, I would be on the tenth floor's hallway.@
` In the distance, there is the faint glow of the lamp marking the fire escape.@
` Apart from that, the world is painted over in darkness.@
` I take a step outside.@
`"…… Is anyone…"@
` I'm about to say "there", but I stop.@
` I don't quite know why, but I feel as though it would be a bad idea to raise my voice.\

` I take another step.@
` Slowly, I enter the hallway.@
` The corridor reeks of the terrible smell.@
` A raw smell.@ The smell of beasts.@
` That, and a grinding sound coming from somewhere.\

`"………"@
` There's been a stinging pain in my neck for a while now.@
` The darkness is frightening.@
` This silence is frightening.@
` …… To find out what happened here is more frightening than anything else.@
` The pain from the back of my neck running to the top of my spine holds back my nervousness.@
` That throbbing pain,
` it's the price of my desperate attempts to repress the urge to just scream and flee.\

br
br
` *rustle* *rustle* *rustle*@
br
br
` *grind* *grind* *grind*@
br
br
` *scratch* *scratch* *scratch*\

`"Ha…!"@
` My breathing goes wild.@
` My body is drenched in sweat.@
` …… Knife in hand, I am unable to take another step.@
` I have the feeling that if I were to move even a little, I would see something unimaginably horrible.\

` *pant*  *pant*@
` But I'll really be in trouble if I don't get back upstairs.@
` …… To stay on this floor is worse.@
br
` It feels like each second passing is grinding a year off my life.@ That's how fast I feel 'death' closing in on me.\

` My breath comes quicker and heavier.@
` Fortunately, I can see where the fire escape is, thanks to the lamp.@
` It's down the end of the hallway.@
` If I can reach that green emergency light, I can go back upstairs.@
br
` Gripping the knife, I set off down the dark hallway.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` -----*splash*\
` I can hear something from beneath my feet.\

`"-----"@
` I guess the hallway is soaked in water.@
` In addition, my feet keep bumping into things as I walk.@
`"-----"@
` Even so, I stay silent.@
` Bearing with the terrible stench smothering me, I head for the emergency light.@
` Only a few more meters to go.@
` Then, I see something squirming beneath the emergency light.\

`"……… Eh?"@
` I break my silence.@
br
` A squishing, lukewarm sound.@
` A dry, grinding sound.@
` The wild panting breath of beasts.\

`"Wh--"@
` Under the green light of the fire escape…
` All sorts of animals are swarming around some human-shaped object.@
br
` I can't tell what sorts of animals are eating it.@
` The hallway is dark, and the emergency light is too weak.@
` That's why all I can gather is this image.\

` ---Numerous cockroaches are devouring the human corpse while emitting a laughing buzzing sound.@
` That's the only way I can make sense of this nightmare.\

` *rustle*@
` There is a noise coming from the direction of the elevator.\

`"Ha----"@
` I turn around.@
` Perhaps it's because my eyes have adjusted to the darkness?@
` Or maybe it's thanks to light from the fire escape, but I now see exactly what sort of condition the hallway I just passed through is in.\

` The hallway is a sea of red.@
` Lying around within that sea are human arms and legs.@
` The soaked hallway.@ Scraggy, hard objects which I felt on my legs.@
` It must have been what I was stepping on.@
`"------"@
` My mind goes blank.@
` The hallway is red only on the floor.@
` Clinging to the ceiling and walls are all sorts of black things.\

` It's not because there are no lights that they look black.@
` They are black to begin with.@
` They don't seem to have any solid shape, sticking to the ceiling and walls like some sort of liquid.@
` But I know they are animals from the eyes.@
` The glinting eyes of the many beast-like forms are trained on me, the only surviving human-----\

`"Hya……"@
` I manage to suppress my scream.@
` The beasts are staring at me intently.@
` They hold their breath, waiting to assault me the moment I scream out.@
`"Ha---hhh."@
` I manage to regulate my ragged breathing.@
` I can feel it, awfully so, that the moment I cry out, they'll all attack me at once.@
` None of the creatures on the wall possess the same eyes.@
` It's almost ridiculous to see even shark-like eyes clinging to the wall.\

`"…………"@
` I order my feet to move, but they won't budge an inch.@
br
` ----I can't move.@
br
` My feet will not move, after having seen a world like this.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` *grind* …… *grind* …… *gr* …… *ind* ……\

` The noise from beneath the emergency light grows smaller.@
` Those beasts are probably finishing off the corpse.@
`"………"@
` My breath catches.@
` The rustling draws closer.@
` It seems--the creatures found their next prey called Tohno Shiki.\

`"Ah………"@
` But my legs would not move.@
` This world is too different, my mind doesn't operate properly.@
br
` ---I've made a mistake.@
` I shouldn't have come to this floor----\

br
` ---Then.@
br
` I can hear a terribly familiar sound.@
` The very normal sound of human footsteps.@
` A completely normal, common-sense sound from the world I lived in until a moment ago.\

`"Aaaaaaah----!"@
` My numbed mind infuses strength into my paralyzed legs.@
` I run.@
` Kicking up soaked blood in the hallway, I dash towards the emergency light.@
` Run.@
` I have to get away from this place as fast as possible…!\

` But that was a mistake.@
` Reacting to my dash, the black things clinging to the wall and ceilings crash after me like a wave.@
`"----!"@
` I dash towards the stairs with everything I have.@
` But the black wave is so many times faster than I am, and in an instant, my body is--\
