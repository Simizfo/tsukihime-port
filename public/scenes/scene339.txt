` Dinner, as usual, is a quiet affair with just me and Akiha.@
` Kohaku-san stands behind Akiha, and Hisui stands behind me during our wordless dinner.\

`"…………"@
` The only thing different is the way Akiha is acting.@
` Until now, whenever my tableware would make noise, Akiha would look up with a scowl.@ Today, however, Akiha makes quite a lot of clattering herself.@
` In the end,
`"---I am going back to my room.@ Please clean up my dinner."@
` Saying so, she leaves the dining room behind.\

`"…… What's with her?@ She wasn't like that when we were walking back together…"@

` Hisui says nothing.@
` Kohaku-san collects the tableware, smiling as ever.@

` ----And then.@

br
` From the lobby, I hear the sound of someone falling.@
`"---Akiha!?"@
` Fearing the worst, I race towards the lobby.\

`"-----!"@
` There, I see Akiha leaning on the stairs.@
` Her breathing is irregular, and I can hear her wheezing from here.@
` Her face is pale, and there are beads of sweat on her skin.@
br
` …… I can see with a single glance that she is not okay.\

`"Hey, Akiha!"@
`"Don't come near me…!"@
`"…!"@
` I stop.@
` Leaning on the stairs, Akiha refuses me violently.\

`"Wha---don't come near you…?@ What are you talking about!?@ I don't know what happened, but I can't just leave you like that!"@
`"---I'm fine, just… don't come any closer… Nii-san."@
` Akiha breathes heavily.@

`"Hey----"@
` My heart pounds.@
` Akiha just breathes painfully.@
` …… There's something wrong with me.@
` For a moment, I feel it resembles the figure of Yumizuka Satsuki.\

`"Aki… ha---"@
`"I'm fine, so please, don't come near me.@ If you come near me, there's no way I'll be able to… so don't come any closer.@ As long as you are not around, I'll be fine, so…"@

` With an audible sound,
` Akiha collapses once more.\

`"Akiha-sama?"@
` Kohaku-san passes me, running toward Akiha.@

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

` She whispers something to Akiha, and helps her up.@
` With Kohaku-san's help, Akiha returns to her room.\

`"Wha----what was that about?"@
` I really don't understand.@
` Akiha's tormented condition, telling me not to come near her, yet she lets Kohaku-san help her.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_mid
`"---Shiki-sama."@
`"Hisui… what was that?@ Why was Akiha like that?"\

`"At times, Akiha-sama lapses into sudden dyspnea.@ Just as with your anemia, Akiha-sama too is a member of the Tohno family."@
`"Ah----"@
br
` ---Members of the Tohno family do have such conditions.@
br
` Akiha said that during lunch.\

`"It can't be… Akiha always seems so healthy."@
`"Akiha-sama tried her best to keep it a secret from you.@ We were also ordered not to speak to Shiki-sama about it."@
`"--------"@
` There's nothing to be said.@
` I can only look aghast up the stairs Akiha just ascended.\

`"Well then, good night.@ Please leave Akiha-sama's condition to Nee-san.@
` As Makihisa-sama was under her care for many years, she has medical experience."@
`"I guess so.@ If we leave Akiha to Kohaku-san, I'm sure she'll be fine."@
` …… Since there doesn't seem to be anything else I can do, it seems I'll have to just leave her to Kohaku-san.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t17.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki-sama, it is rare for Akiha-sama to be like that.@ Since it can be easily relieved with medication, I do not think that you need to worry.@
` …… Rather than being concerned with her treatable condition, Akiha-sama is concerned more about your health, Shiki-sama."@
`"---I know.@ Damn it, I'm a crappy older brother.@ I guess I really didn't realize anything at all."\

`"You---do not know anything?"@
` Hisui murmurs to herself, looking down.@
`"Hisui?@ What is it?@ Don't say that even you feel bad."@
`"---No, it is just… Shiki-sama, do you really remember nothing about the detached building?"@
`"-----Eh?"@
br
` …… Remember… what?@
br
`"…… Hisui, that's…"@
`"---You really became Tohno Shiki, did you not, Shiki-sama?"\

`"Hisui?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… That detached building fell into disuse right after you left for the Arima family.@ Makihisa-sama decided to demolish it, but as Akiha-sama objected strongly, it remains standing today.@

` ---So, Shiki-sama, if you think anything at all of Akiha-sama, please do not approach that detached building."@

` Saying so, Hisui leaves the room as if she were running.\
