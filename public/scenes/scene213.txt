` Yesterday, at this same time.@
` I remember how natural the parting was between Yumizuka and I.\

`"…………"@
` To be honest, I'm concerned about Yumizuka.@ But no matter how much I worry, there's nothing I can do.@
` I told her I would help her as much as I could whenever she was in a pinch.@
` But now, I don't even know how I can help.\

` I reach the top of the hill, walk along the wall and reach the front gate of the mansion.@
`"…… This western mansion does seem out of place."@
` In the middle of a residential area and at the top of a hill, this imposing mansion really does give the impression that it is from a country other than Japan.@
` Besides, to top it all off----

`"Welcome back, Shiki-sama."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` And standing there in front of the gate to welcome me is a maid.@
` Hisui stands like a statue in front of the gate.\

`"Thanks, Hisui…… Um, forgive me for asking, but have you been waiting for me here the whole time?"@


`"No, not the whole time.@ I have only waited for half an hour.@ Is there something wrong?"@
` She speaks extremely matter-of-factly.@
` …… Wait a minute, waiting for me like that is going overboard.\

`"---I'm really happy that you waited to greet me, but you don't have to go that far.@ Wearing that and standing so conspicuously, I feel a little embarrassed."@
` Plus it is autumn.@ It'll get pretty cold out soon.@

`"……………………"@
` Hisui is silent.@
` She might be part foreigner, as her blue eyes are like finely crafted glass, staring at me lifelessly without emotion.@
` A brief silence ensues.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… I understand.@ Then, starting tomorrow, I will wait in the lobby."@
` Hisui gives a brief bow and opens the gate.@

` After that, she resumes her immobile depiction of a statue.@
` After I walk through the gate and enter the garden, she quietly follows behind me.\

` When we reach the entrance, Hisui whooshes past me.@
`"Uwaa!"@
` I instinctively jump back.@

`"…… What is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"Uh, no-----nothing, it's nothing."@
`"……………"@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` She silently opens the front door.@
` She must have moved ahead of me to do so.\

` Waiting behind her master until her turn arises and quietly fulfilling her duty.@
` Perhaps that is the duty of a maid, but it makes a normal person like me a little nervous to have her attending my every move.@
` …… This isn't good at all.@ This just makes me feel like a perpetual guest in my own home.\

`"Um, Hisui?"@

`"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"@
`"I said this yesterday already, but I'd like to do things that I can do by myself.@ No, please let me.@
` This is sort of a secret, I suppose, but the truth is, I really am pretty lazy deep inside, so I tend to let things go."@
` Yeah, I really want that to be a secret from Akiha.\


`"…… I do not understand, are you telling me to be more strict?"@
`"No, that's definitely not it.@ I just want to live as relaxed as possible."@
`"…… I am deeply sorry.@ I do not appear to understand what you are saying, Shiki-sama."@
`"…… Um, that's why I'm saying--you don't have to look so serious."@
` …… This is troubling.@
` Last night when I talked to her a little about this I had a premonition, but I didn't know she took things this seriously.\

`"---Sheesh, what I'm saying is that you don't have to worry about me.@
` I don't mind being helped with things like laundry and cooking, but other than that, I can take care of myself.@
` Isn't it just you and Kohaku-san taking care of this enormous mansion?@ So I don't want to add to your duties; just relax!"@

`"………"@
` Her expression doesn't change.@
` She doesn't answer or even give a nod.@
` Just… a quick closing of the eyes, I think.\

` ----Argh, she doesn't understand at all………@

` Hisui swiftly swishes to the side to make way for me.\

` I sigh.@
` …… I am really taken aback…@
` All this devotion really does make me happy, but I think it'll be good if she was just half as cheerful as Kohaku-san.@
` She has such a beautiful atmosphere around her, maybe if I just relax a little bit, that would be--\

`"Shiki-sama, are you not going to return to your room?"@
`"No, I was just thinking about something."@
` I turn to the side and face the stairs.@
` Hisui looks rather longingly at the bag in my hand.@
` …… I think she wants me to let her carry it.@
` She already went through all this trouble just to greet me, and now she wants to carry my bag.@
` I ignore her longing attitude as I quickly walk towards my room.\

`"Akiha-sama is in the salon taking care of Makihisa-sama's business and inheritance matters.@ Nee-san would most likely be sweeping in the courtyard."\

`"…… Huh?@ My old man's business inheritance?@ Is she talking with a lawyer or something?"@
`"Yes.@ It seems that she is being informed about all of the administration policies, so she will be extremely busy until dinner time."@
