` I finally decided that I would return the ribbon.@ It took weeks after settling things with Arcueid and Ciel to weave my way through all the lies being told at the Tohno mansion.@
` 
` I think I finally, really recovered all of my childhood memories, so I'm ready to give this ribbon back to that very special girl.\
` I told Akiha to meet me underneath the tree.@

`"That's right…@ Akiha, I'm sorry it took me so long to notice, but I finally realized everything… I should give this back to you.@ This is really why I came back."\
` I'm really laying it on pretty thick with that line, but it seemed pretty good to me while I was rehearsing most of the morning.\
