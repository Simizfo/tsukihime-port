` I feel the morning sunlight.@
` I keep my eyes closed as I try to fall asleep again, but the gentle sunlight keeps urging me to open my eyes.@
br
` ---Slowly, I start to awaken.\

` A quiet atmosphere.@
` The air is comfortably cold, and yet it feels gentle.@
` I guess the weather will be great today.@
br
` ---Then, I should get up and go to school.@
br
` That's right, I have to go to school.@
` The past three days, my life was in chaos and it made me forget I was a student.\

` I wake up.@
` I'm lying on my bed, and my glasses are on the bedside.@
` I put on my glasses and look around.@

` The sunlight streams so strongly through the window, I almost expect to hear it pouring through.\

`"----"@
` I take a quiet breath.@
` I fill my lungs with fresh air, and it feels like my chest is purified.@
` I hear the clock ticking.@
` Small birds chirp in the woods outside.@
` I stay on my warm bed, aimlessly feeling the relaxed passage of time.\
br
` -----Ahh, I'm back.@
br
` Even though there's nothing special about this morning,
` Right now----I feel like there's something almost holy about it.\

`"----Thank goodness."@
` It really is good.@
` Not the fact that I'm alive, nor that I was able to do something about that black vampire.@
` But that even though I was in such a world, I was able to return to my normal days and feel happy about this morning.@
br
` ----And then.@

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."\

`"Uwaaaa!"@
` I jump up in my bed.@
` Now that I look, Hisui is standing quietly at the side of my bed.@
`"Hi-HiHi-Hisui---"@
`"…… Please excuse me, Shiki-sama, but since you did not notice, I spoke."@
`"Ah---well, I mean, I'm sorry, too."@
` Hisui respectfully bows to me.@
br
` ---Sh-she surprised me.@
` My heart is still pounding rapidly.\

`"---Huh?@ But it's still before seven o'clock, Hisui."@
`"Yes.@ It is a bit earlier than your usual waking time, Shiki-sama."@
`"Well, yes---then why are you here, Hisui?"@
`"I came to wake you up.@ Akiha-sama wants to know what have you been doing these last two days so she wanted me to bring you no matter what."@
`"----Ah."@
` …… I forgot.@
` Come to think of it, I skipped school last Saturday and was with Arcueid through all of Sunday.\

`"…… Don't tell me, Akiha's angry…?"@
`"I do not know.@ Please confirm for yourself, Shiki-sama."@
br
` ---Hisui's voice sounds very cold.@
br
`"…… Wait a minute.@ Before that, why am I sleeping in my room……?"@
`"Shiki-sama, you returned around two o'clock in the morning.@ Nee-san found you sleeping in the doorway and carried you up to your room."\

`"Wha------"@
` …… My mouth hangs open.@
` That's bad----Not contacting anyone for two days, returning in the middle of the night, and sleeping by the doorway.@ I'm acting like a drunk!@
br
`"----That woman----treating me like some sort of cat----"@
` Arcueid's face flashes in my mind.@
` …… But, maybe I do have to be thankful for her carrying me as far as the entrance.\

`"---Alright.@ I'll head down immediately.@ Umm… and, if possible, I'd be happy if you tried to calm her down as much as possible."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----I refuse."@
` She answers.@
` …… Maybe Hisui might be also angry at me.\

`"---"@
` Ugh, one problem after another?@
` The owner of this mansion is Akiha, so does this mean that if Akiha's angry, no one is there to defend me?@

` Well, time to get up.@
` I can't do anything staying in bed.\

`"Ts………!"@
` O----ow.@
` As soon as I stand, pain shoots throughout my entire body.@
br
`"----Last night's--wounds?"@
` …… Oh yeah.@ If there's anything to be surprised about, it's the fact I'm still alive.@
` Even though I was that wounded and bloody, I still managed to wake up normally.@ It just isn't natural.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki-sama, those are----"@
` …… That's rare.@
` Hisui widens her eyes and looks at me.@
`"What, is there something wro----"@
` I look down at my body.@
` And----
br
`"Wha, what is this……!?"@
` A pattern of red spots covers my pajamas everywhere.@
` Of course this design wasn't ever here; it's my blood soaking through everywhere.\

`"------"@
` Hisui suppresses her words.@
` --I'm thankful.@
` It lets me calm down.@
` …… The reason for the bleeding is clear.@
` But since I can't tell her why, I have to lie to make her not worry.\

`"Shiki-sama, your body----"@
`"…… I'm fine, nothing hurts.@ See, didn't I come back late at night?@ Truth is, I was in a fight, and that's why I came home late.@
` These wounds are from that fight, and they're just scratches, so don't worry about them."@
`"------"@
` Hisui's eyes implore me, saying, "Please do not tell lies."@
` But from her standpoint, she probably can't ask me any further.@
` …… I feel sorry, but I'll have to stick with my lie.\

`"Um, so could you please not tell Akiha about this?@ She would get really mad if she heard about me getting in fights."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----Yes, I understand.@ Definitely, Akiha-sama will not find out."@
` Hisui nods.\

`"Thanks.@ Ah, I have another request.@ Do you have any disinfectant?@ I have a lot of scrapes all over my body so I want to take care of them."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah----Yes, I will bring some right away."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_fst

\

`"……?"@
` What is it?@
` She looks really uncomfortable all of a sudden.@
` In any case, I'm glad she went to get me some disinfectant.@ Once she brings it here, I can take care of it by myself.@
` It's only slight pain, so anything that hides the blood is good.\

`"Thanks for waiting~"@
` The one who opens the door and walks in isn't Hisui, but Kohaku-san.@ In her hand, she carries a box with a red cross on it.\

`"Huh, Kohaku-san----?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, I heard the situation from Hisui-chan.@ Shiki-san, you went out and got in a fight?"@
`"Ah…… no, not really, I----"@
` I can't come up with any other explanation.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Geez, you shouldn't be doing those things.@ It's okay to be naughty, but you shouldn't be violent.@ It's just painful for the one doing it and the one receiving it."\

` Painful for the one hitting and the one getting hit, huh.@
` Kohaku-san's words hit me pretty heavily.@
br
`"…… Yeah.@ That's… right.@ Hitting… is only painful."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Isn't it?@ I am disappointed you have those wounds.@ No matter what the situation was… I will be disappointed in you if you keep on doing these kinds of things, Shiki-san."@
` Her words penetrate sharply into my chest.\

br
` ----Deep inside my heart, I want to apologize.@
br
` Sorry, Kohaku-san.@
` I probably----did numerous things to make her disappointed in me.\

`"----Yeah, I'm an idiot and I regret it.@ I won't ever do it again."@
`"As long as you understand, then that is fine.@ I'm going to examine your wounds, so please take off your clothes."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

`"----Eh?"@
` Kohaku-san pads over and grabs my shirt.@
` She's telling me to get naked here.\

`"W-Wait!@ You don't have to go that far.@ I just wanted to put a little disinfectant on a few scrapes, that's all!"@

`"What are you saying?@ Even if you say you only have a few scratches, they don't look that minor."@
`"No, I'm fine.@ I can do it by myself."@
`"That won't do.@ The ones on your back----"@
` Seeing the wounds on my back, Kohaku-san gasps.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----How terrible.@ Did you get into a fight with a Doberman, Shiki-san?"@
`"…… Yeah.@ Well, something like that."@
`"--------"@
` Kohaku-san sighs in amazement.@
br
`"Geez, now I really can't let you handle it, Shiki-san.@ Come on, please hurry up and take off your clothes.@ With your clothing on, I can't take care of you!"@
`"No, I said I can do it myself!@ They aren't a big deal, I don't need to be naked……!"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"----I see.@ You must be embarrassed, Shiki-san."@
` With a smile, she goes ahead and tries to remove my pajamas anyway.@
br
`"I am already used to seeing your body, Shiki-san.@ Please just take off your clothing."@
`"…… 'Used to', Kohaku-san?"@
`"I have already changed your clothing once so I know every detail of your body."@
`"W-W-Wha?"@
`"Let's go, we haven't much time.@ If you take too long, Akiha-sama will notice."\

` ----Ugh.@
` I can't argue with that.@
` But, to get naked in front of Kohaku-san, it's……
br
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… I guess it can't be helped.@ Then, I will only examine your upper body.@ This way, there isn't anything to be embarrassed about, right?"@
` Even that's embarrassing, but I guess that's the best compromise.@
cl c,%type_crossfade_mid

`"………… I guess so.@ Then, please do."@
` I sit down on my bed and take off my shirt.\

` Kohaku-san expertly tends to my wounds.@
` She carefully tends the wounds on my arms, shoulders and back.@
` The disinfectant sinks into the wounds.@
` They sink in, but compared to my occasional dizziness or the pain from my old scar, it's nothing.@
` While applying the disinfectant,
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Wow, you really are a boy."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Kohaku-san says happily, so it probably helped me to put up with all the pain.\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Now we have to stick on this compress patch.@ It may rub off, so let's bandage it."@
` She puts a compress over my bruised chest and wraps a bandage around it.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"All finished.@ Are you sure you don't want me to do your legs?"@
`"Yeah, I can do the rest.@ …… Thanks, Kohaku-san.@ I know you're busy and all."@
`"No, no.@ Please do not worry about it.@ Then I'll be going back to the kitchen.@ When you are finished, please come to the dining room, okay?"@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Kohaku-san walks to the door.\

`"Ah, Kohaku-san."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes?"@
`"Um----sorry.@ Like you said, fighting is just stupid.@ It's just a big bother, and nothing good ever comes from it."@
`"------"@
` Kohaku-san looks at me in amazement and then suddenly starts to laugh happily.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
