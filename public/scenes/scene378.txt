` Calming down,
` I manage to restore control over my breathing.@
` My view painted in red now returns to normal.@
` One more calming breath.@
` I won't believe what SHIKI says.@
` I would never kill Akiha, and there's no way I would kill someone simply because they weren't human.\

` It's different.@
` It's different from back then.@
` I'm different from SHIKI.@
` I can control my actions through my own willpower.@
` It's just, the smell of blood is so strong.@
` It makes me remember the past, and that scares me.\

` My right hand is still holding the knife.@
` With my bare left hand, I wipe the blood off my chest.@

` Eight years ago.@
` We fight to death once more at the place where SHIKI almost killed me.\

`"…… Hmph, you did come after me."@
` SHIKI is sitting down at the very edge of the clearing.@
` Even that is the same as back then.@
`"……………"@
` I hold onto my knife and walk towards him.@
` I feel something slimy under my feet.@
` SHIKI's blood has not stopped; all the flowing blood is from him.@
` Splash, splash.@
` His blood makes noise as I step towards him.@
` …… It's amazing he's alive after losing this much blood.@
` It's like a giant puddle on the ground.\
