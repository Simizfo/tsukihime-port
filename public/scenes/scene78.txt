` Fortunately, it's further away for her than it is for me.@
` If I set off while pretending to talk, I can probably make it to the main street.\

`"Oh yeah.@ We still don't even know each other's names yet.@ I guess it is a bit too fast to ask you to cooperate with me."@

` I'll have you take responsibility for killing me."@

` …… There are all sorts of responsibilities in this world, but this is probably the first and last time someone takes responsibility by helping someone they've killed.\
`"…… Damn it!@ Do whatever you want."@
` But there's nothing else I can do.@
` I grudgingly extend my left hand and shake hands with the woman in white claiming to be a vampire.\
