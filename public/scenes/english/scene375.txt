` ---Born into the Tohno family, I had an older brother.@
` But I could not get along with him.@
` My parents told me he was my brother, but he seemed to me like something else.\

` Having the Tohno blood means having the blood of nonhumans.@
` That might be why he looked different to me, but for me, he did not appear like "that" either.@
br
` I could not truly accept my brother.\

` And when I turned six,
` a strange boy joined our life as another brother.@
` At first, I did not like the boy's name, as it sounded exactly like my brother's.@
` The boy was a few years younger than my brother, but he was mature and kind to everybody.\

` Even though I was restricted by my family's creed, the boy took me around to play like it was completely normal.@
` As I followed him silently, I started to take interest in my new brother.@
` He was loud, unsettling, and a bit rough, but…
` Somehow, I knew this person would protect me no matter what.\

bg "image\bg\bg_36a.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid


` As a daughter of the Tohno family, I lived separately from my brother and the boy.@
` Father says I am not able to live a normal life due to the special blood of the Tohno family.@
br
` I managed to endure strict studies by accepting my fate.@
` …… Father is not doing this because he does not like me.@
` I tell myself that he scolds me really, really harshly only because he loves me.\

br
br
br
` My mind is getting worn out.@
` The mind I had was cut down as it started to become smaller and smaller.@

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

br
` But I felt that I could endure it.@
` Because I have a bit of free time I can use to play outside with everyone after my studies.\

bg "image\bg\bg_42a.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid


` The three of us started to play together.@
` My brother and the boy got along really well.@
` I usually followed them silently.\

` My brother seems to know that the boy was different from us.@
` I also know that time flies by when I play around with normal people like them.@
` Since I knew, I wanted to value this time.@
` Wishing that when I mature and become alone in this prison-like mansion,
` I would not be lonely and refrain from crying because I have these happy memories.\

` ---The memories were numerous.@
br
` There were really special times within the special days I had.@
` There was the night I went far away with the boy.@
br
` On a dark night, the two of us in the field, surrounded by trees.\

` Every day was warm like a parade.@
` But,

` A hot summer day.@
` I saw my brother in the courtyard and walked towards him.@
` He was panting painfully as he was crouching on the ground.@
br
` I had a really bad feeling about it.@
br
` I could hear the cicadas and the ground seemed to tilt.@
` Feeling myself starting to get dizzy, I called out to my brother.\

` The brother that turned around was not my brother.@
br
` I could not do anything.@ All I could do was watch my brother turn into an ugly beast.@
` The thought that I would turn into something like him in the future caused me to freeze in place.@
br
` The blood-thirsty beast attacked me.@
` I could not run away.@
` At that moment, someone pulled on my hand.\

` The boy was there when I turned around.@
` He pulled my hand and ran.@
` …… Is he not scared?@
` The boy stood in front of that ugly beast as if to protect me.@
br
` But the beast was only watching me.@
` The beast that attacked me, and the boy that came in between us.\

` Splash.@
` I remember the moment warm blood splashed onto my cheeks.\

` …… The boy embraced me and protected his sister from the beast.@
br
` Even though his body had a hole and was bleeding seriously, he still embraced me.@ He protected my small body and did not let go.\

` When I looked up, he was crying.@
` The tears looked like they were from regret, and not pain.@
br
` ---I'm sorry, said the boy.@
br
` Before he died, he embraced me, hoping his dead body would still protect me.\

` The boy continues to apologize.@
br
` If I was part of your real family, I could probably protect you.@
` It's so frustrating---I couldn't be your real brother.@
` I swore---you would be more important to me than anyone else.\

` …… He died whispering that confession.@
` The boy wished for my safety even after he died and he tried to be a brother more than my real brother.@
br
` …… Those words were enough.@
` I cannot wish for anything more.@
` I understood---I cried knowing that this person will never betray me.@
` Even though it was imprudent, I embraced him back and cried from happiness.@
` I was happy that I could think this was the only person for me no matter what happened.\

bg "image\bg\ima_11.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid


` I do not know what happened after that.@
` When I came to, the only memory I had was the body of the beast getting dragged somewhere, and the body of the small boy being carried into the mansion.\

bg "image\bg\bg_41.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

` And my father told me.@
` He said the adopted son died in that accident and that my real brother was the one who survived.@
` …… I knew that was for appearances for the outside world, but I did not care.@
br
` He was alive.@ I cannot possibly wish for more.@
` …… Even if the boy becomes my true brother in name, and even if the boy himself thinks that way,
` I told myself that it would be fine as long as I could stay beside him as his sister.\

bg "image\bg\bg_36a.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

` …… Eight years have passed and our father died.@
` I ascended to full power over the Tohno House and I decided to bring him back to the mansion, ignoring the surrounding opposition.@
br
` There is no freedom for me as the successor, but I might be able to act selfishly at least once.@
` Then----I would like to use that one wish for my love that will never be mentioned.\

` That was good enough for me.@
` I have taken away everything from him.@
` So I cannot wish for more.@
br
` ---Back then.@
` The kind of happiness I had while watching the stars together would never happen again, but,
br
` as long as he is here, I do not care.@
` If Nii-san would come back.@
br
` ---On a dark night, the two of us in the field, surrounded by trees.\

`"--------!?"@
` I avoid it instantly.@
` The red sword SHIKI was holding came down without getting stuck anywhere.\
` During that swing,
` the sword was indeed in the ceiling, but it came arcing down like a hot knife through warm butter.\

`"Persistent-------!"@
` SHIKI holds up his sword once again.@
`"----------"@
` My mind stops.@
` In my vision is SHIKI and Akiha, sitting at the back of the room.@
` Akiha blankly stares at me and SHIKI.@
` Akiha sits like a doll.@
` Akiha.@ I can't leave Akiha here.@
` But right now----
`"Ku----!"@
` I bite my tongue and get away.\

` I go through the shouji door which leads out to the garden.@
` If that sword does not hit the walls, then I'm at a disadvantage inside.@
` Outside, the forest.@
` In this dark night, in these woods, there should be some advantage for me----\

` I suddenly feel dizzy.@
` My feet stumble as I almost fall.@
` The wound in my back reopens and blood pours forth.@ No time for that.@
`"Ugh-----"@
` I let out a breath.@
` Stumbling, I lean against a tree.\

`"Tu…………"@
` I can't pass out here,
` I hear the sound of someone moving through grass.@
` SHIKI is definitely after me.@
` Then, just a little more.@
` I need to go at least to some place where I can hide and attack him from behind-----\

` Twice.@
` The sword that comes flying pierces through the tree easily.\

`"--------!"@
` My body moved before I thought about it.@
` I hide my body from tree to tree.@
` The swords are following close behind.@
` Is there no end to this?@ His swords are thrown one after another like bullets.\

`"What------"@
` There is no end.@
` As I run away, he increases the amount of swords he throws at me.@
` When I notice,
` The dark forest is full of pierced trees, looking like some sort of foreign execution site.\

`"----Huh?@ Are you done running away now, Shiki?@ Don't tell me you think you can kill me here……!"@
br
` I can hear his voice.@
` But he does not throw his sword.@
` As I can't see him, maybe he can't see me… no, no way.@
`"Ha………… a."@
` I straighten out and lean on a big tree.@ His sword shouldn't pierce through a tree this big.\

`"Hey man, where's all that talk you gave me earlier!@
` If you're going to kill me, it's no fun unless you try……!"@
` The voice echoes as I still cannot tell where he is.@
` I close my eyes and try to make my hearing more sensitive.\

`"…… Let's see.@ If that's the case, I'll have to make this a bit interesting.@ It's no fun just to kill you.@ It's easy to skewer you right now, but I bet Akiha won't be happy about that."\

` …… That dripping sound.@
` It's closer this time.@
` The sound is from the tree right in front of me.@
` When I look,
` I see it's the sound of liquid dripping down the sword that pierced the tree.\

`"Yes, I should crush your hands and feet and make you a toy for Akiha……!@ Akiha likes to play with dolls, and it would suit her."\

` …… It doesn't seem to be sap.@
` Some kind of liquid is dripping down that thin sword.@
` When I look at it harder, it seems more like ice melting into water.\

`"Oh yeah, I haven't told you this yet but Akiha right now is a bit out of my hands.@ I guess I was too happy and I overdid it.@ It's good she's back, but it's a problem when she bites anyone she sees, right?"\

` …… The liquid drips down.@
` The red sword is more like a blade itself than a sword.@
` A simple weapon, just a blade.@
` This is the weapon SHIKI was throwing.@
` A red, thin, long blade.@
` But why is that dripping red liquid?@
` Red.@
` Red.@
` Re…… d?\
