` The cafeteria is packed, as usual.@ A long line of people waiting for their orders has developed.@
` Casting a glance at the students holding their meal tickets, I sit down at Arihiko's table.\

`"So, Arihiko, who is this special guest?"@
`"Uhhh… that's odd.@ We arranged to meet here in the cafeteria.@ Hold on, I'll go check things out."@
` Arihiko runs off, leaving his curry udon.@
`"……"@
` Chikara udon is my choice.@
` I hope he returns before the noodles go stale.\

`"It's no good.@ Looks like Senpai went somewhere."@
`"Hmm?@ Your guest is a senpai?"@
`"Yeah, she's a really cool girl.@ I've been hitting on her for the last few days, and I finally got her to agree to eat lunch together.@ Apparently she has someone she wants to thank today, so she's running around school looking for whoever it is."@
` *sigh*@
`"…… It seems like she's a busy person."@
`"Yeah.@ She's kind of like one of those Penny Racers."@
` With a look of regret, Arihiko splits his chopsticks.\

`"Well, I guess it can't be helped.@ Anyhow, itadakimasu."@
`"Yes, itadakimasu."@

`"So, what was the real reason?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Huh?@ What do you mean?"@
`"The reason you were early this morning.@ You aren't the sort of person who comes to school early just because he gets up early, Arihiko-kun."@
` I question Arihiko as I sit next to him, eating my chikara udon.@
`"Hmmm."@
` Arihiko gives an uncommitted response as he slurps away at his soup.@
`"Are you going back to your real house today, Tohno?"@
`"Yeah, I am… wait, have I told you about that already?"@
`"Nah.@ I just heard it from the teacher."@
` Arihiko continues to wolf down his curry udon without glancing in my direction.\

`"I thought, 'Maybe Tohno will get really depressed!' so I decided to check it out."@
`"…… I see.@ And your verdict?"@
`"Pretty disappointing.@ It wasn't worth getting up early for."@

`"You really have too much time on your hands, Arihiko," I conclude, as I bite into the white rice cake in my chikara udon.@
` …… That's the kind of person Arihiko is.@
` Today is the day I return to the house of my real family, returning from the home of the adopted family who raised me.@
` Arihiko must have heard about it somewhere and came to school early because he was worried about me.\

`"…… Arihiko, I think your appearance does you a disservice.@ You're really sentimental underneath."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Heh, heh… If it's the always-melancholy Tohno telling me that, then maybe I'm the real thing."@
` Arihiko slurps noisily at his noodles.@

`"So man, what's really going on?"@
`"What do you mean?"@
`"You've been living with the Arimas since primary school, right?@ It's been eight years already.@ Your dad has basically disinherited you.@ Why is he suddenly calling you back now?"\

`"He didn't 'disinherit' me.@ He just kicked me out of the house somehow."@
`"Tohno-kun, if there ever was a family that kicked their kid out of their house 'somehow', that's not a tragedy, it's a comedy.@ But it's so boring, it's not even funny."@
` Arihiko spreads his arms and shrugs.@
` Refusing to be serious, ever, is one of Arihiko's easy-to-understand traits.@
`"…… Yeah, I guess you're right.@ If you get kicked out of the house, laughing is all you really can do."\

`"And then he said some cliche line like, 'Never step foot in this house again!' or something, right?@ That's what people would call disinheritance.@ Come to think of it, I've never heard why you were disinherited."@
`"……"@
` …… Who knows?@
` That's something I'd like to know too.@
`"Well, if you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to."@

` Grabbing his bowl with both hands, Arihiko drains what is left of his hot curry soup.@
` Lunchtime is short.@
` Following Arihiko, I decide to quickly finish my chikara udon.\
