` Since Akiha's actually home for a change, I guess I'll pass the time talking to her.\

` Hurried sounds can be heard from within.@
`"I just wanted to talk for a bit, if that's okay?"@
`"Ah---yes, please, come in."@

`"……… Hmm."@

` Akiha sits on the chair of her desk.@
` I lower myself into a suitable chair, and glance around Akiha's room.@
` It's an amazing room, but of course it's not really my type of place.@
` I haven't even been able to settle into my own room, and it has just the bed and the desk; if they'd given me a room decked out like this, I might have fled.\

`"Hey, Akiha."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t12b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes?@ What is it?"@
`"Um, it's just something I've been wondering about for a while.@ Why did you call me back?@ The old man died, and while I am the eldest son, that doesn't seem like much of a reason."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What do you mean, not much of a reason?@ This is your home; it's only natural for you to come back here.@
` There doesn't need to be a reason."\

`"Well, that's true, but… don't you have a grudge against me?@ I left you here for eight years."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t03b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, of course I have a grudge.@ It was father's fault you were sent to live with the Arimas, but it really made me mad that you didn't send even a single letter during that time."@
`"Uh---no, that was…"\

`"That was what?@ Come on, Nii-san, what is it!?@ You come in here to remind me of things I almost forgot!@ Do you enjoy making me angry that much?"@
`"No!@ Of course I didn't do it to make you angry.@ The thing about the letter, I didn't do it because that old man forbade me to do it, so---"@

` With a sound of annoyance, Akiha looks away.@

` After I took the trouble to come and talk to Akiha, why am I talking about such unimportant things?\

`"Well, I guess it's like you to carry such small matters forever.@
` Kohaku said so too, right?@ This is your home.@ You should be more relaxed."@
`"Yeah… I think I'll get used to it, gradually.@ But---"@
`"But, what?"@
`"Well, no, it's just… there's no nostalgia.@ I remember life in the mansion, but I'm confused, because none of this matches my memories.@
` Well, I guess I've been away for eight years, so it's natural."\

`"Nii-san, I have a question I forgot to ask, too.@ It's… about the injury from your accident eight years ago…"@
`"Hm?@ Injury from the accident… you mean, the wound in my chest?"@
`"Yes.@ Kohaku said it hasn't completely healed yet, but… does it still trouble you?"\

`"Hm… I don't know.@ The actual wound itself healed ages ago, but there's some unstable organs that got damaged.@ I heard that some of those would heal in time, but some would stay unstable.@
` …… I guess my incessant anemia is the result of that, in addition to some emotional damage from the accident."@

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

`"Does it… um, hurt, Nii-san?"@
` Akiha murmurs a question, looking away.\

`"…… Nah, it doesn't hurt anymore.@ I just feel a little dizzy when I wake up, no worse than that."@
` Well, perhaps it hurts occasionally in the dead of winter.@
`"The dizziness has faded lately, and I'm sure the anemia will go away in a few years.@
` Anyway, it's nothing to worry about.@ There are people out there with wounds they won't recover from for twenty years, so my wound's nothing in comparison."\

` Akiha says nothing, still looking away.@
`"…………………"@
` Damn.@
` The atmosphere has become heavy again.@

` Akiha looks up.@
` She lacks all vitality, as if she was passed out until now.\

`"What's wrong, do you feel bad?@ If you do, you should lie down.@ I'll go back to my room."@
`"Nn---no, that's not it.@ I was just…… listening to you, I was remembering about the past---"@

`"---No, it's alright.@ It's not as bad as yours, but I get easily dizzy too.@
` …… I was just thinking about the accident eight years ago.@ Your wound was so deep, and there was so much blood coming out of it---that's why I felt so bad."\

`"…… I see.@ If that's so, but don't push yourself.@ If you feel bad, please tell me."@
