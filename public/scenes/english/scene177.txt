` Time is the only thing which passes by.@
` A quiet night.@
` It's completely different from two nights ago and there isn't a single cloud in the sky.@
` The bright, pure moonlight illuminates the park and Arcueid.\

`"…… Moonlight……"@
` If it was as bright as this back then, maybe I could have seen the bandaged man's face…… wait a minute…

`"Ah----------!"@

` I jump up from the bench.\

` Arcueid rushes towards me.@
`"No, that's not it---I forgot something really important."@
` It really was careless of me.@
` I was attacked yet I completely forgot about it until now.\

`"Arcueid.@ I was attacked two nights ago by a strange person."@

`"…… Yeah, that's how it was------"@
` Finishing my explanation, I read Arcueid's expression.@

` From when I started until now, her eyes remained sharp without any gentleness.\

`"So what is it Arcueid?@ That bandaged man, and that person wearing those robes like some priest, are they enemies of yours?"@
`"…… Yes.@ Both of them are 'enemies'.@ I don't know just who or what that bandaged man is, but that woman wearing those Catholic robes, I have an idea about."@
` She narrows her eyes as if she was in a bad mood.@
` No, she looks less like she was in a bad mood and more like she's irritated.\

`"I may know the person who helped you, Shiki.@ …… Man.@ If it's really her, she'll probably be able to find the enemy before me."@
` She bites her lip vexedly.@
`"Wait a minute.@ I didn't say that person was a woman though."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"No, there's no mistake.@ That woman is the only agent given authority to hunt heretics alone and who uses Black Keys that combine the Cremation Rite and the Steel Shell Effect."@
` Her irritability is almost like hostility.@
` Even when she spoke about Nrvnqsr, her voice was never saturated with emotion to this extent.\

`"…… Arcueid.@ Um, that person who helped me, is she a vampire……?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"No, that's not it----that's right, I have yet to tell you about something else that's very important."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I think I explained it before, but vampires like the one making his lair in this town turn humans into their minions and expand their territory.@ At the same time, they try their utmost to conceal their existence.@
` Even though victims appear, they use various magical techniques to make things appear not out of the ordinary.@
` You know why?"\

`"…… Well, it's because humans aren't stupid.@ If they find out monsters like that exist where they live, they'd attack them.@ Even though humans are weak, they do have things like police, so they might be able to do something."@
`"---Well, I guess that's true, but police are only a law-enforcement group against humans.@ We don't consider them at all.@
` But, it's correct to say that vampires hide their presence for the sake of self-preservation."\

`"Shiki, there is a natural enemy of the vampires.@ A group of something like professional killers that now have the power balance in their favor.@
` …… It's true for other transcendent species, but especially for vampires, it is fatal for them to reveal themselves.@
` Even if a vampire made a secret kingdom in a village somewhere in the mountains away from all civilization, this natural enemy would definitely notice if victims keep increasing.\

` Vampires exploit the humans in secret, for no reason other than self-preservation.@
` The vampires hide their dead victim's bodies, not out of fear of human society finding out, but in fear of these natural enemies discovering them."@
`"…… Huh?@ The natural enemy of vampires?@ Yet another group of monsters I don't know about."@
br
` For a normal guy like me, I just want all these unnatural things to stop appearing.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"What are you saying?@ Their natural enemy is without a doubt you humans."@
`"-----?@ Natural enemies, us?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yeah.@ Starting from a long time ago, humans used many kinds of magic, the occult, magical ceremonies to create an organization and started to eliminate primates other than humans.@
` The greatest of these is Christianity---the pride of the Vatican, the Exorcists.@ The Catholic Church always viewed "nonhumans" as impurities, but vampires are considered the most dangerous."@

` "There are many religious groups in the world, but the Catholic Church looks at vampires with more hostility than the rest.@
` You know, it's almost an obsession.@ They are so insane, I don't even want to mess with them."@
` Arcueid lets out a sigh.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"The one who helped you was a member of an elite organization that hunts heretics.@
` This group, the Burial Agency, is part of The Church.@ They use their own strength rather than law to deal with contradictions to Christianity.@ These hidden exorcists are more like professional killers."@
`"…………"@
` Priests that go around exterminating vampires, huh?@
` It's so fitting, I'm not really sure what to say.\

`"Then aren't they like us?@ If this Burial Agency is a group whose purpose is to hunt vampires too, can't we search together?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"----That won't work.@ For them, it's enough that someone is a vampire.@ To them, non-human primates are just "Evil".@ It doesn't matter if they suck blood or not.@
` This exorcist may have even just came here to seal me rather than fight the vampire who lives in this city."\

` Sounding irritated, Arcueid starts to pace back and forth again.\

`"………………"@
` Things have gotten quite complicated.@
` Arcueid's enemy is sought after by both a vampire, and a group that hunts vampires.\

`"…… What is this?@ Then doesn't that mean she's all by herself?"@
` Thinking aloud, I watch Arcueid as she paces back and forth.@

` Under the white moonlight,
` Arcueid appears to be dancing a solitary waltz.\
