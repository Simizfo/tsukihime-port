` There isn't exactly a way to search for the serial killer.@
` The only thing I can do is wander the streets and look for anything suspicious---or I use myself as a decoy to bring out the killer.@
br
`"………………"@
` After what happened with Yumizuka, maybe I've become numb to danger.@
` Since the serial killer is just a human, I can roam the streets without any nervousness.\
