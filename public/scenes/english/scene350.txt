`"No.@ I just thought I might go home with you, Nii-san, so I came here…"@
`"I see.@ It's lucky we didn't miss each other.@ Well then, let's go.@ Kohaku-san and Hisui are waiting."@

`"Oh, that's right, there's a question I've been wanting to ask you, Akiha."@

`"A question for me…?"@
`"Yeah.@ Why did you have that dislike for Senpai?@ Did you know her already, by any chance?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, I met her for the first time yesterday.@ My dislike for her is simply psychological, so you don't need to worry about it."@
`"Psychological?@ What do you mean?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t21.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I mean, I can't control how I feel.@ It's the same as how you felt about father, so please don't worry about it."\

`"---Hold on, Akiha.@ I just disliked the old man, I didn't hate him."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\aki_t13a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"I don't hate her, either.@ …… I suppose I exaggerated things today.@ I'll reflect on it, so please look leniently upon the affair at lunchtime."@
`"…… Right.@ I guess that's okay, then."\

` …… Well, I guess it might not be a problem.@
` Ciel-senpai often comes by at lunch, so if relations between Akiha and her are bad, it'd be a problem.@
` At this rate, with Akiha saying things like this, me and Arihiko might not end up on pins and needles on the sidelines----\

` I toss my bag on the desk, and sit down on the bed.@
` Well, what should I do?@
` It seems Akiha has lessons, and as soon as we got back, she went somewhere by car.@
` …… That's right, Hisui and Kohaku-san were busily walking about too.@
