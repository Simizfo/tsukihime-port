` The hallway stretches quite a long distance.@
` When I was a child, I believed that this hallway would go on forever.@
` The mansion seemed as large as a castle, and every day, I would walk a bit around the mansion and would carve my name on the wall, the pillars, or the floor.@
` It was sort of a game I would play with Akiha to see who could take over the mansion.@
br
` Saying that wherever we put our names became our territory, the two of us walked around the mansion carving our names here and there.\

`"…… Here."@
` On the handrail by the stairs is carved the name SHIKI.@
` It was probably because of these games that my old man forbade us from playing inside the mansion.@
` Anyway, if I look closely, I can see both mine and Akiha's name all over the place.\

bg "image\bg\bg_48a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid
` I go outside.@
` …… Come to think of it, most of the time we spent playing was in the garden.@
` Since Akiha was obedient to the old man, unlike me, she could only play outside for about thirty minutes a day.@
` And still, she usually just stayed behind us, watching and listening.@
` But she would energetically run out with us and compete with us in whatever games we would play.\

`"…… Perhaps her personality stems from those times?"@
` She might have suppressed herself in front of the old man.\

` On the walls of the mansion, the carved names appear again.@
` Shiki, Shiki, Akiha, SHIKI, Akiha, SHIKI, Akiha, Shiki, Shiki, SHIKI, Shiki.@

` In the forest of the mansion, I can see a clearing as if the trees were cut there.\
br
` ---No, "can see" is not quite right.@
` If you walked by normally, you probably would never notice it.@

` --------I saw a dream.\


br
br
br
` It was a dark night.@
` In the middle of the night, I thought I heard a noise and I woke up.@
` The tatami room was otherwise empty.@
` It seems at some point, all the adults went outside.@
` I was a little uneasy all by myself.@
` I went outside to the garden to see where they went.\

br
br
br
` The night itself feels frozen by the winter cold.@
` My breath hangs white in the air.@
` The garden is cold, but at the same time, the sky was beautiful.@
` The expression "freezing cold" seems to have been made up just for this winter night.@
` The cold stars.@ The deep darkness.@
` Illuminating this world is the lifeless moonlight.\

br
br
br
` For a child like myself, the mansion's garden is too big.@
` A dense forest encloses the garden.@
` The mansion is deep in the mountains, and to be honest, is no place for anyone to live.@
br
` The mansion is in the very heart of a dark forest.@
` It is…
` like the light of a luminescent fish at the bottom of the ocean.\

br
` The darkness of the forest swells deeply.@
` The trees are like a black curtain trying to reach for the moon.@
` I heard a noise, and was convinced the adults must have gone into the forest.@
` I enter the forest.@
br
` Not even a single ray of light exists in this darkness.@
` Unable to even see my own body, I walk towards the sound.@
` It's just   cold.@
` Even my eyes become numb.@
` I feel as if someone is calling my name.\

br
br
br
br
` A reed warbler's cry.@
` The swaying grass.@
` There, I met a red demon.@
` The demon does not seem to be interested in me.@
` At the same time, I am not concerned with the demon either.@
` Crimson.@ Red.@ Vermillion.@
` I walk past the field that has turned into a crimson sea.\

br
br
br
br
br
` The trees part into a clearing.@
` There, the scattered corpses of all the adults are littered all over the ground.@
` The dark ground is bathed in poisonous red, as if the entire world was bleeding.\

br
br
br
br
br
br

` ------That is.\

br
br
br
br
br
br

` In the middle of the bleeding earth, the enemy that slaughtered the adults is standing there.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ------The very first nightmare.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` The enemy approaches to kill even me.@
` My mother dies, protecting me.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ------Blood splatters onto my face.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` In the middle of this frigid night.@
` That warmth.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ------The first hated color.\

br
br
br
br
br
` The claws of the enemy pierce my chest.@
` Maybe I was numb from the coldness.@
` I didn't really feel much pain.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ------I look up at the heavens.\

br
br
br
br

` My pulse races even faster than before.@
` Her fingers grip me tightly.@
` Her tongue licks me hesitantly.\

`"Nn----ha, n ,……"@
` Her inexperienced lips are still weak.@
` But her tongue still caresses the tip of my shaft.@
` Gradually, her tongue becomes more active.@
`"…… Kk…… Hisu… i……!"@
` This sensation shoots up my spine.@
br
` ----My heart beats.@
br
` …… Just a moment ago, the fact that Hisui is the one doing this set my body afire.@
` But that's ending.@
` Now her action seems like she's got the hang of it, growing more and more confident.\

`"…… Mn…… nna---n……"@
` Hisui starts breathing violently.@
` The sensation of viscous fluid.@
` She uses the tip of her tongue to lick the opening at the head of my penis.@
`"K----ha……!"@
` My hips jump a bit.@
` I desperately try to resist the sensation that is welling from my loins to my testicles.\

`"Hisu…… i, stop---"@
` My heartbeat rages in my ears.@
` The hot feelings start to accumulate and redouble…
`"Nn…… na…… n---"@
` Hisui does not stop.@
` Little by little.@
` Her lips start to creep lower.\


` ----Thump.@
br
`"…… N, …… n, …… u…… n."@
` Hisui's flowing hair.@
` Hisui's lips, which weren't moving before, start to move up and down.@
br
` With a slurping noise.@
` Hisui's saliva and my fluids continue sliding up and down beneath her lips----\


`"Ah---a,a----"@
` A gasp escapes my lips.@
` The feeling of Hisui wrapping me with her mouth.@ The mixture of pleasure and pain that shoots from my hips, through my back and up to my brain.@

br
` The sound of gentle slurping.@
` These erotic sounds get louder.@
` Hisui just continues to passionately suck at my shaft.\

`"Nn…… nn,n…………!"@
` Gripping.@
` Hisui's fingers continue to grip me harder.@
`"-----A… ha……!"@
` …… My breathing is out of control.@
` …… I start to blank out.\

`"A…… n, nmu……"@
` Hisui's breathing almost sounds pained.@
` Her mouth full, the exhalations from her nose flow over my penis.\

` -----Thump.@
br
` My shaft starts to get wet.@
` It's not just that, but Hisui's fingers are wet as well.@
` Dirty.@
` Those beautiful fingers are covered in two kinds of fluid, hers and mine.\

` -----My… heart… is pounding…
br
` It feels like it's telling me to go crazy.\

`"…… Nn…… Shiki…… sama."@
` Hisui suddenly draws away from my rod… maybe the smell is too much for her.@
` A string.@
` A thin thread stretches from her lips, connecting the two of us.\

` The sound of breathing.@
` Wild breathing.@
` From me, not Hisui.@

` ------Thump.@

` My heart is about to burst.@
` My body is about to shut down.@
` This---this kind of pleasure… I don't want it.@
` Not enough.@
` This is not even close to enough.\

`"…… Shiki-sama…… are, you feeling… better……?"@
` Hisui's voice is full of hesitation.@
` *pant*…… *pant*…… *pant*……
` Still unable to move even my arms, I just breathe in and out.@
`"…… If that felt good…… then please, bear… just a little more."@
` Taking a deep breath, Hisui once again lowers her head.\

` My arms grab her head.@
`"……!@ Shiki-sama, what are……!"@
`"Hi… sui----"@
` I put some power into my arms.@
` And I forcibly push her head down.\

`"Nn-----!?"@
` Her lips make a wet, sliding sound.@
`"Nn---,n… n----!"@
` Hisui tries to pull her head back.@
` But… my arms do not allow her.\
`"Hisui---more---"@
` With ragged breath, I say such a selfish thing.@
`"Nn----ha,n,ah---!"@
` Hisui tries to breathe.@
` Before, it was Hisui embracing me with her mouth.@
` But now it's different.@
` Now I thrust my whole shaft into her mouth.\


`"Nn-----n, n----!"@
` Opening her mouth, Hisui manages to take it all in.@
` There is no resemblance to the enthusiasm of before.@
` Now it feels like she is just trying to escape.\

`"…… Hisui…… does this hurt?"@
`"Nn----n, mu."@
` Her breathing flows against my shaft.@
` I start to feel the pressure of her teeth.@
`"I see.@ Then I'll let go."@
` I pull my hands off her head.@
`"Nn…… ha, ah."@
` Breathing painfully, Hisui tries to lift her face.@

` Hisui freezes.\

`"-------"@

`"N…… nn,ha……"@
` Hisui swallows me deeper and starts to move.\

`"Nn…… mu, nn, n……"@

`"A…… n, n, Ah……"@
` Instead of breathing in air, she's breathing in me.@
` The sensation of being inside a woman's mouth.\

`"Nn---na,n----"@
` Hisui is no longer able to hold her saliva in.@
` It's flowing much more than before.@
` Sliding… Sliding.@
` Hisui's dirtied face.@
`"Ha----Hisui, it's really----"@
` Matching Hisui's sliding, I start to move my hips.@
` I hit the back of her throat.\

` It must really hurt her as she starts to bite down.@
` Hisui bites with enough power to leave tooth marks.@

` Her gripping fingers.@
` Her hair sways wildly.@
` She continues to caress me.\

` The blood pounds in my shaft.@

` My semen starts to well up.@
`"Ha,a---I'm going to come, Hisui……!"@

` But my arms move on their own.@
` I start to come.@
` I don't try to hold back, and I don't let Hisui escape.@
br
` In my ecstasy, I release everything into Hisui's mouth.\

`"Nn----Ah,nn------!!"@
` Splash.@
`"N----,n----!"@
` Hisui tries to pull back with a pained expression.@
` But my arms do not allow it.@
` I force her to take everything.\

`"----Ah, ah, ahh--!"@
` At the same time, her throat starts to move.@
` *pant*…… *pant*…… *pant*……
` With that, I let her go.\
