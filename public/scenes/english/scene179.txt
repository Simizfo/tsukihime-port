` …… I press the doorbell.@
` It doesn't seem like anyone's coming out.@
`"----Shit, she hasn't come back?"@
` No matter how many times I push the button, her door doesn't open.\

`"………"@
` Did she not come back, or is she just not coming out?@

` ----After hesitating, I decide to go inside.@

` It'd be a simple thing to cut the "lines" on the door.@
` But, I should just check the knob first.\

`"…… Huh?"@
` It's not locked.@
` The door opens simply with a turn.\

` All I can do in this situation is to trust her and wait for tomorrow night.@
`"………………"@
` With a great uneasiness in my chest, I return to the mansion.\
