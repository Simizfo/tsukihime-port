` I realize that someone is taking care of me.\

`"Good evening.@ How are you feeling, Shiki-san?"@
` She speaks with her usual smile.@
`"Ah…… Kohaku, san."@
` I somehow manage to speak through my tattered breathing.@

`"Ah, you do not have to speak.@ I probably understand your condition better than you do."@
` She removes the towel from my forehead, still smiling.\

` ---Was that thing before just an illusion?@
br
` Kohaku-san is acting normal.@ She keeps smiling and continuing her portrayal of Hisui.@
` …… That.@
` Am I going to die here without being able to take off that mask?\

`"Akiha-sama told me everything.@ She said that she would wait until tomorrow, but that may be too long.@
` Akiha-sama seems to have lost her ability to think clearly.@
` I don't think you'll be able to make it through the night like that, Shiki-san."@
`"---------"@
` *wheeze* *wheeze*
` Kohaku-san's words are unmercifully true.\

`"Shiki-san, you told me before.@ You said that you were numb to death.@
` Is that still true?@ Are you still going to act against Akiha-sama hopelessly with a body like that?"@
`"---------Kohaku-san?"@
` …… I'm surprised.@
` Kohaku-san's voice, it's completely different than before.\

`"…… No way.@ I told you that I am more attuned to death than most people…… So I think I understand the situation I'm in.@
` Without you telling me---I knew that surviving the night will be extremely difficult."@
`"Then you are not scared of death?@ If you accept Akiha-sama then you will recover quickly, but you still do not.@ There's something wrong with you."\

`"…… Maybe.@ But, I think it's okay.@ I like the me that acts like this, and I like Akiha for liking me as I am.@
` …… Yes, and, well… I enjoy small things like just being able to talk with you, Kohaku-san.@
` …… But I feel like if I lie to myself, all those small things would lose their enjoyment, and I'm scared of that----"@
