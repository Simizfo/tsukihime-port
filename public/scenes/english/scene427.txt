`"You made a mistake, Nii-san.@ That was your last chance to kill me."@
` The enemy stops.@
` Her breathing and stare are full of confidence.@
`"--------"@
` That means, this distance right now is her maximum range in this dark hallway.\

`"You were so quick earlier.@ I thought I would still lose sight of you even in this narrow hallway with your speed.@
` But, that won't happen with this distance.@ I am close enough to see the color of your eyes, so I can easily track you."@
`"---------"@
` No matter how fast I dash, she is saying she will kill me before I get close.@
` But---that's only if I dash toward her.\

`"……………"@
` She narrows her eyes.@
` Is she bothered by the fact that she has my life in the palm of her hand, or that I am so calm?@ …… Or, does that cause her to hesitate?@
` Whichever one it is---just like SHIKI thought, she really doesn't understand what a battle to the death means.\

`"---You look like you're planning something, Nii-san."@
` She says the obvious.@
` There's no need to answer.@
`"--------Is she stupid?"@
` I mutter and switch my knife to the other hand.@
` I take it from my dominant hand and place it in my left.@
` I have figured out her range.@
` All that's left---\

`"---Ridiculous.@ You're getting scared now."@

`"I-----I'm not scared……!@ You're the one being scared and not able to move!"@
`"…… Okay.@ You can kill me, right?@ Then you should do so.@ If you do nothing, I'll kill you the next time you blink.@
` ---I'm about sick and tired of seeing your face."@
`"---------!"\

` The air around her swirls.@
` Her desire to kill starts to embody itself in her red hair.@

` Her gaze, and the surrounding air that turns crimson and tries to wrap around my arms at the same time.\

` More than anything, I slice the red hair coming to wrap my dominant hand.@

` I then switch the knife to my freed dominant hand.@
` I slice the hair around my left arm…… It took a bit to free myself on this hand.\

` I jump back even more.@
` ---The red hair chases me.@
` It isn't as quick as before, but still wraps around my limbs.\

` …… No, chasing isn't the right word to use.@
` There is no way to escape this red hair.@
` When she sees me, it is already wrapped around me.@ It is wrong to imagine dodging it or avoiding it.@
` If it's there, it's there.@ If it's not, it's not.@
` Like the air touching my skin, the red hair is already wrapped around me.\

` Therefore, there was no way to escape from that attack.@
` If there is anything I can do, it is---before Akiha steals something from me, I have to cut that pipeline…… that red hair of hers.@
` The interval between her seeing something and stealing from it is only an instant.@
` But if the target isn't clear in her vision, there is a small time before she actually steals from me.@ Before she can steal too much from me, I cut the hair to avoid a fatal wound.\

` That's all I'm doing.@
` Even though I can see her image of "red hair", it doesn't make a difference that her ability is overpowering.\

` ---Maybe she's taking it easy, but she follows me without running.@

`"--------"@
` I cut the hair that comes to bind my arms, legs and body continuously.@
` The left arm that I sacrificed to confirm her power doesn't move at all.@
` There's no pain.@ There's no blood.@ But despite my clothes, I can tell that a big part of the flesh is taken away by burn wounds.\

`"--------Tch."@
` What's making me uneasy is that the open flesh sends sickening cold air into me.@
` Thanks to that, I can't concentrate fully on escaping.@
` My efforts to escape Akiha's gaze gradually become slower and I soon stop.\

` ---And, it now becomes Akiha's range.@

` ------Crash.@
` I jump back to the stairs, and jump down them without using the steps.@

`"What---!?"@

` …… I hear her voice coming from above.@
` I was only jumping straight back this whole time, so she could not react to me moving sideways.@
` …… Well, I planned to reach the stairs while moving back, so it's no coincidence.\

`"Why you…………!@ Stand still………!"@
` Akiha looks down the stairs to try to see me.@
`"-----Now,"@
` Before she can do that, I jump down one more time.\

` This is the second floor.@ I can jump down outside and still be okay.\

` But then, I'll end up like SHIKI.@
` I have repeated what happened in that dream this much, so I shouldn't have to copy what SHIKI did to every detail.\

` ---Did she see my leg as I went down the stairs?@
` I'm outside her visual range, so this won't be fatal, but----\

`"Shit…… she's more wicked than I thought."@
` I cut the hair.@
` My left leg---It's now just like my left arm.@

` The sound of footsteps comes closer.@
` Before she enters the hallway, I dash into a classroom.\

`"------,-------,----"@
` Holding my breath, I lean against the wall between us.@
` …… I don't believe it.@
` Half of my body might as well be dead.@
` I was aware of it, but I didn't think I'd end up copying that dream this much.@

wave se8

` …… Tap, tap, tap.@
br
` The footsteps draw nearer and nearer.\

`"--------"@
` In my dream, SHIKI was killed right after this.@
` …… SHIKI's decision wasn't incorrect.@ He just didn't have a full understanding of Akiha's ability.@
` The burnt smell of the air.@
` The temperature's scorching resemblance of deep summer.@
` And the body parts that disintegrate with burning pain.@
` All of these facts made SHIKI think that Akiha's power was 'burning' the enemy.\

` But the truth is just the opposite.@
` Akiha entangles her target with her red hair and completely steals their "heat".@ This causes instant freezing followed by vaporization, making it look like it disintegrated.@
` If it truly was burning, then matters would be hopeless once the flame was lit.@ No matter how many times the red hair is sliced, it's not possible to cut off your own body.\

` But---that is just stealing and taking in.@
` Therefore, even if I get completely wrapped by the red hair, as long as I can cut off the hair before I am completely drained and kill Akiha herself, then there's no problem.@
` While she lives, she can turn her target into an inferno.@ But that illusion of fire will die when Akiha dies.\

wave se8

` …… Tap, tap, tap, tap.\

`"------"@
` I was already prepared to have my left arm burned when I stuck it out.@ I was prepared to cut it off from my shoulder once it lit up, but there was no need for that.@
` Akiha's ability will not kill me if I can stop Akiha herself.@
` Since Akiha is not a true flame user, a surprise attack cannot end up in mutual death if she dies before me.\

`"--------"@
` I hear a sound.@
` I hear her footstep right behind my back.@
` Without a doubt---Akiha is about to pass the classroom without even noticing I am here.@
