` I leave the mansion.@
` …… What the hell is going on?@
` Even though there's no one around, I can feel the presence of people.@ Buildings.@ From the houses around me, I sense people.\

` *pant*----*pant*------
br
` With all these people here, I won't be able to hold back again.@
` Somewhere---I have to go somewhere without any people around or I'll never be able to calm down.@
` Where no one is.\
` Where there's no residences nearby.@
br
` …… Somewhere, where even if I go crazy again, I won't cause anyone any trouble.\

` …… *pant*…… *pant*………
` There's no one else in the park.@
` There's no houses nearby.@
` …… No one's supposed to be here, but I still can't calm down.@
` No matter how far away they are, there are houses all around here.@ I can see the lights of town in the distance, too.\

`"It doesn't, exist."@
` Yeah, it doesn't exist.@
` There's no place in a city where you can't sense any presence of humans.@
` There's really no place where I can truly be alone in this civilized city.\

`"Damn-----it."@
` All around me.@
` So many people all around me.@ If I walk just a little, I can catch all the prey I want.@

`"Shut---up."@
` My head hurts.@
` Even though I finally don't see the "lines" anymore, I'll start to see them again like this.\

`"----Eh?"@
` Wait, Shiki.@
` Isn't this strange?@
` Because it's not like I was seeing these "lines" because I was excited.@
` Those "lines" are things I can't help but see when I don't have my glasses on.@
` So even if I'm calmed down, I would still see them if I don't have my glasses on.@
` But I have dropped my glasses---\

`"----They're… here."@
` I bring my fingers to my face and find out my glasses were there all along.@
` In other words,
` Even if I wear the glasses Sensei gave me, I cannot control my eyes anymore.\

`"Ha---haha."@
` I am hit with the truth.@
` Just like Roa said, I just didn't realize that I was already insane.@
` That night.@
` Ever since that time when I wanted from the bottom of my heart to kill that bastard who was disgracing Ciel.\

`"…… Oh…… then, the headache from that time was……"@
` The headache from when I was fighting Roa.@
` When I saw those "lines" of death even when I don't remember taking off my glasses, and when I got Ciel-senpai to go find them for me.@
br
` Since that time, I---even when I wore my glasses, regardless of what my intentions were, I've been able to see those "lines".\

`"…… Senpai…… knew."@
` No, she probably just didn't tell me.@
` So as not to worry me, she lied to protect my mistaken perceptions.@
`"…… I see…… Sen…… pai."@
` She told me to talk to her if anything happened.@
` I've already memorized her phone number.\

`"Phone---"@
` There's a payphone nearby.@
` But---what am I going to do by calling her?@
` No one can heal my body.@
` Even Ciel-senpai can't heal what's inside me.@
