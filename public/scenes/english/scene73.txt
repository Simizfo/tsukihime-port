` As I approach the school, I begin to catch sight of more and more students in uniforms.@
` It's Saturday, so most of them are smiling while they walk.\
` It's only a little way to the main gate once I pass this intersection.@
` It's still only seven-thirty.@
` Looks like I'll be able to get to school with time to spare today.@
br
` The light turns red, and I stop in front of the cross walk.@
` The school fence is just on the other side.@
` Since it's a school path, the footpath is protected by a guardrail.@ Even now, the students in front of me are heading towards the school gate.@
br
` There's no one but students from our school on the other side at this time of day.@
` …… There should be no one but the students.@
` But between the cars rushing by, I feel like I catch a glimpse of someone in white.\

`"-----Wha……"@
br
` She is there.@
br
` Dressed in white, with golden hair down to her shoulders.@
` Long, slender brows and red eyes.@
` I've seen her only once before, but there's no way I could mistake her for someone else.\
`"------"@
` But that's impossible.@
` I killed her myself yesterday, cutting her into pieces.@
`"Wha----"@
` No.@ Even that's a lie.@
` It's all just a dream.@ Hisui told me so----\
`"-----"@
` No, she didn't say anything of the sort.@
` It's just that I wanted to believe it was a dream.@
` Then it really wasn't a dream.@
` But then…
` Why?@ Why does she exist, as real as anything---?\
` The light turns green.@
` The students around me walk towards the other side.@
` I'm the only one amongst them who stands there, stunned.\
` She sits on the guardrail, her legs swinging idly,
` as if she is waiting for someone.@
` I can't tell how long she's been waiting, but her expression isn't a grim one.@
br
` ---Who is she waiting for?@
br
` She fidgets restlessly, as if she were waiting for her lover.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---I have a bad feeling about this.@
`"Ah-----"@
` The girl in white looks over in my direction.@
` It's probably nothing more than a coincidence.@
br
` She's just a stranger who looks like her.@ She must be waiting for someone else.@
` If not, then this moment must surely be a bad dream, too.@
` After all, I completely and utterly killed her with my own hands----\
` But she's looking this way and smiling.@
` Looking very satisfied at having found the person who killed her, her smile seems to say, "you've finally come----"\

` Giving a familiar wave and a smile, she hops off the guardrail.@
` Fluttering her hair, she heads towards me.@
`"------Don't come."@
` This… is a bad dream.@
` The light turns red.@
`"------Don't come near me."@
` She doesn't even look like she cares, walking straight across the street while the cars pass by.@
br
` There's only a few meters between us.\
`"…… I'm telling you not to come----!!!"@
` The reality before my eyes does not change even when I scream out.@
` Screaming in a voice even I don't understand, I run from the girl in white.\
