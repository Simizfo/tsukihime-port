`"Whatever.@ Anyway, we at least know his weapons are twenty or thirty familiars.@
` …… So now we can understand why he's called Chaos."@
`"Eh……?@ His name really isn't Chaos?"@
`"Yeah, most long-lived Dead Apostles don't use their names from their human lives.@
` But they don't make up a new name themselves, The Church assigns them one.@
` They add on names as they find new, special characteristics of the vampire so some of them have names as long as spells."\

`"…… And, I guess The Church must really have hated him to name him Chaos.@
` It would have been enough for one lion to hunt the entire hotel, right?@ But he let loose all of his beasts to feed, meaning he seems to enjoy such excesses."@

`"………………"@
` …… Thirty beasts inside the vampire Nrvnqsr.@
` Just with that, he killed and ate without trace a hundred people at the hotel in thirty minutes.\


`"----I can't believe it.@ He's a complete monster."@

`"Yes.@ He really is the worst opponent I could have at the moment.@ He's one of those you never want to meet.@
` But what's worse is that such a guy knows where we are.@
` Even now I'm sure his familiars are watching us."@
`"Wha----"@
`"Isn't it obvious?@ We were saved earlier because the sun rose, but we can't count on that tonight.@ He knows of this place so he will certainly come to kill us at the height of his power at midnight."\

`"Come to kill us, tonight……?"@

` ----What is this?@
` He----that man in the black coat is coming tonight?\

`"------"@
` I… don't know what I should say.@
` I should escape.@ I know that's the wisest decision.@
` But Arcueid is in this condition.@
` Even if she ran away, I don't think she could escape from that monster.\

` No, less about her and more about me.@
` If I stay here----if I stay involved with Arcueid, there's no mistaking the fact I'll face him.@
br
` He is… dangerous.@
` Clearly put, he isn't sane.@
` More than his body which houses those animals, his eyes are like a machine's.@
br
` Devoid of even a single emotion.@
` The true eyes of a killer which does whatever it is assigned to do.@
` As one who has experienced his attack, I am sure that without a doubt, he is to be avoided.\

`"------"@
` But, does that mean I should just leave Arcueid here and run away?@
` No matter who she is, she can't move because she protected me.@ And I can tell her good luck and go home------?@

`"Arcueid, I----"\
