` -------Suddenly, I awaken with a start.\

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]The night is pitch black.@
`[center]And no one else is in the house.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]It's scary, being alone in the dark.@
`[center]So to find everyone, I head out into the garden.\

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]Our mansion's gardens are vast fields of green.@
`[center]Surrounded by a thick, dense forest.@
`[center]With the trees blanketing out the light,
`[center]almost like a massive curtain.\

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]Like a stage in a theater somewhere.@
`[center]The curtain of trees opens with a swishing sound.@
`[center]Excitement fills me, 
`[center]anticipating the beginning of the grand play.\

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]In the distance, I hear the sound of echoes,
`[center]beyond the black curtain of trees.@
`[center]Inside the forest,
`[center]the sounds of everyone happily playing around.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]The curtain doesn't open yet.@
`[center]Unable to restrain myself, 
`[center]I wander into the darkness of the forest.\

br
br
br
br
`[center]Darkness surrounds me… 
`[center]A blackness so deep, it's suffocating…
`[center]Not even the calming rays of the moonlight can reach this deep.\


br
br
br
br
br
`[center]The air is cold…
`[center]A winter's chill so deep,
`[center]my eyes feel like they'll freeze.\

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]For a brief moment, I thought I heard someone call my name,
`[center]so I walk even deeper into the forest.\
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]After passing through the veil of trees,
`[center]I find everyone waiting for me in the forest clearing.@
`[center]But, something is wrong… 
`[center]Everyone is lying on the ground…
`[center]…… Everyone is lying on the ground…… in pieces…\
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]The clearing is bathed in red.\

br
br
br
` ---I don't understand.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` A stranger approaches.@ 
`[center]The look on his face says he wants to rip me apart…\

br
br
br
br
br
` ---I don't understand at all…\


br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]But, someone else, someone I don't know… steps in front of me,
`[center]and is torn apart in my place.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---I'm just a kid, so, I really don't understand.@
\

bg "image\bg\ima_13b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]A splash.@
`[center]Something warm and wet hits my face.@
`[center]It's red…
`[center]A red liquid, red like a tomato.\

br
br
br
br
br
`[center]The person that was torn apart,
`[center]that person I called "mom",
`[center]never called my name again.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` -----I really don't understand.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]But it is just so cruel…
`[center]I wanted to cry, I just felt like crying.\


bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_crossfade_slw

br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]Warm crimson blurs my vision.@
`[center]Seeping into my eyes.@
`[center]But it doesn't bother me at all.@
`[center]The lonely moon floats above me,
`[center]bearing witness in the night sky.\


bg "image\bg\ima_01.jpg",%type_crossfade_slw

br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]It's strange.@
`[center]Why didn't I realize until now?\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---Such a cold, horrible nightmare.\


br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]Yes---I didn't realize it.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]That tonight…\
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`[center]The moon is so------beautiful----\
