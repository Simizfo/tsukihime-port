` It looks like no ideas are forthcoming.@
` Before I knew it, the classroom was empty.@
`"---I guess I'll go home."@
` What a waste of time.@
` If I had time to think, it would have been more productive if I just faced Akiha without any plans.\

`"Tohno-kun!"@
` Someone calls my name as I step out into the hallway.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Thank God you're still here.@ Um, are you going home right now?"@
`"Umm, something like that.@ Since I don't have anything to do, I was thinking of just going straight home.@ Are you heading home too, Senpai?"@
`"Yes, since I don't have anything I have to do, I was thinking of going shopping."@
`"I see, shopping.@ You mean by the station?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"No, it's on sale here."@
` Senpai starts to talk weird again.\

`"…… Here--you mean here?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` Yes, says Senpai with a big smile.@
`"…… What's on sale here?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"This."@
` Senpai points with her finger.@
` Only my face is in her slender finger's way.\

`"You mean, me?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, since you're still here, I've decided to buy your time.@ So let's go home together, Tohno-kun."@
` Senpai tugs at my arm and starts to walk.@
`"W-wait a second, I'm glad we can go home together, but isn't your house in the opposite direction of mine?@ Did you come by just to walk together to the gate?"@
`"No, I'm going to go shopping by the station, so we'll walk together for a while."@
`"I see, then we will be walking together for a while---wait, what are you shopping for anyways?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Well, I thought since it's starting to get cold, I should buy some heating equipment."@
`"Heating equipment, huh… I think it's a bit too early for that, but I guess autumn goes by quickly.@ So what are you buying?@ An air conditioner?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"A high schooler can't afford an air conditioner.@ So, I was thinking of buying the cheap, efficient, traditional Japanese craft, Kotatsu-san."@
` I never knew kotatsu was a traditional Japanese craft.@
` With that aside.\

`"----Senpai, you were going to talk me into carrying your stuff, right?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's not true.@ I just thought we could walk together for a bit, and you could accompany me while I shop."@
`"…… And you would say this to me after shopping.@ Tohno-kun, I can't carry such a heavy load!"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t10a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey.@ Tohno-kun, I wouldn't ask you to do such a thing.@ Even if I did, I'd ask in a much more roundabout manner."@
`"You're right.@ Either way, I'd tell you I wouldn't want to do it."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ahaha, it's alright.@ I would never ask you to do such a thing."@
`"I know you're not that kind of a person, Senpai."@
` We laugh together for a while.@
` We were laughing together for a while, but Senpai suddenly drops her shoulders.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…………… Meanie."@
` Oh no, I guess I made too much fun of her.@
` She was relying on me, so maybe I should have cooperated with her a bit more.\

`"---Alright.@ If you'll buy me lunch next time, I'll do the carrying or anything else you want me to do."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"You don't have to help me if you don't want to.@ I just thought it might be a bit too heavy for me alone."@
`"What are you saying?@ There's no way you'll be able to carry it with your weak arms.@ I'll go.@ You said you'll buy my time, Senpai.@ I'll work for lunch, so take advantage of that all you want."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"--Alright.@ I'll take your kind words and I'll rely on you today."@
`"Yeah, rely on me all you want."@
` I hit my arm to appeal to her that I have some power in there.@
` Senpai laughs and starts to walk.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, I wanted to ask you one thing before that."@
`"What?"@
`"Can I bring you a bentou for lunch?"@
` Of course.@
` I found myself nodding even before I thought about it.\

` We exit to the school grounds.@
` There's no one out here except for the track team.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"There's less after school activity now."@
` Senpai says this regretfully.@
` Due to that vampire incident, most of the after school clubs have been cancelled and the only guys that are left are the track team.\

` …… But that incident will not occur again.@
` Since Yumizuka is no longer alive, there will be no more victims.@ But I bet no one would believe me even if I said that.@
`"…… You're right.@ There's been several victims, so I guess the parents had a say."@
`"I feel a bit down.@ I liked that after school atmosphere."\

`"Huh-?"@
` At the same time, I face an unexpected person.@

`"Geez, you go home late too, Nii-san."@
`"A, Aki-"@
` As I start to finish with "ha", Senpai comes along.@

` It seems that Akiha understood the fact that Senpai and I were going home together.@
` She stares at Senpai and me as if criticizing us.@
`"Akiha---what are you doing?"@
`"I thought I would go home with you, Nii-san."@
` Akiha answers while staring at me coldly.@

`"Tohno-kun, is that your little sister?"@
` Senpai glances at Akiha.@
` They don't say it directly, but both Senpai and Akiha tell me with their eyes to "Introduce me to this person".@
br
` -------*sigh*@
` It seems like this is going be a really tiresome job.\

`"Senpai, this is my younger sister, Akiha.@ She transferred to our school just today."@
` Akiha bows to Senpai.@
`"I see.@ Hello.@ My name is Ciel and I'm a friend of Tohno-kun."@

`"Is that true, Senpai?"@
` …… Before I could tell her to go home, Akiha questions Senpai.@

`"Yes, but I'll do so on another occasion.@ Tohno-kun, you should be nicer to your sister."@

`"Bye" says Senpai, and she walks away from us.\

`"------Hey."@
` Senpai leaves without giving me a chance to stop her.@
`"Let's go home, Nii-san.@ It will get dark soon."@
` Akiha says this as if nothing happened.\
