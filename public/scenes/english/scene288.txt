` It becomes morning and I finally manage to lock the door.@
br
` *pant* *pant* *pant*
br
` My beast-like panting fills the room.@
` My head hurts.@
` It seems I dropped my glasses somewhere.@
` Seeing the "lines" all over my room, I feel nauseous.\

` *pant* *pant* *pant*
br
` I feel so sick, I cut all of them I see.@
` I feel just a little better.@
` Only during the instant I cut things apart does my heart feel at ease.@
` But the more I cut, the thirstier I get.\

` *pant* *pant* *pant*
br
` I know what I'm thirsty for.@
` I'm thirsty for everything.@
` Everything I see is pissing me off.\

` They look miserable.@
` I can't forgive that they are living meaninglessly even though they have death built into them.@
` Why don't they die?@ They all have an end they can't escape, so why do they still exist like that?@
` If it will end anyway---where is the meaning in existence?@
` Everything I see is ghastly.\

` But if I close my eyes, all I can remember is the sensation of killing.@
` The sensation of a hard, unbloodied blade,
` softly uniting with pulsing flesh.@
br
` There can't be a greater stimulation for a human than that.@
` A terrible sensation that almost makes me want to bite my tongue off.@
` It doesn't matter if it is a positive or negative feeling.\

` Especially in my case.@ Because my first was the best beyond all belief, it's hopeless.@
` …… Arcueid.@ The pleasure I got from severing her body into seventeen pieces still burns in my brain and won't go away.@
br
` Those beautiful body parts.@
` The appearance of a human, but with a tenacious life that surpasses far beyond that of people.@
` The enjoyment I had from the killing has faded.@ That time, I didn't kill Arcueid, but I must've killed my brain instead.\

` *pant* *pant* *pant*
br
` I want to destroy everything,
` kill everything.@
` I know that's wrong, but I don't think I can hold it in.@
` My body is filled with excitement; I'm about to go insane.\

`"Shiki-sama, are you awake?"@
`"----!"@
` I can hear Hisui's voice from the other side of the door.\

`"Shiki-sama, it is not good if you keep the door locked.@ If you are awake, please open the door."@
`"………… Op…… en…………?"@
` Open the door?@
` Open the door and let Hisui inside?@
` ---You must be kidding me.@
` If that happened, I don't know what I would do.@
` Like this---if I stay alone like this, lying in bed with the curtains shut, I can stave off the desires that threaten to overtake my mind.@
` That's why, if Hisui comes in here, I'll---\

`"---Shut up!@ Leave me alone!"@
` I scream at the door.@
`"…… Shiki-sama?@ Are you not feeling well?"@
`"I said leave me alone……!@ I'm fine, so just leave me alone……!"@
` If she---came in this room, something I couldn't take back would happen.@
br
`"…………"@
` After a deep silence, I hear her footsteps.@
` Quietly, she walks away from the door.\

` *pant* *pant* *pant*
br
` ---Now it's safe.@
` Thinking that, I calm down just a little.@
` I should---I should just read a book to unwind.\

`"H---uh?"@
` The book that was always beside my pillow isn't there.@
` The book written in English …… I definitely can't read it, but it was a way to kill time.@
` I search but I can't find it.\

` But I can't.@
br
` *pant* *pant* *pant*

`"The book---the book."@
` Come to think of it,
` Why did I even put that book by my pillow?\

` I don't know.@ I don't even remember bringing it here.@
` I don't know where I brought it from.@
` In the first place---did that book even exist?\

br
br
br
br
` …… Really, you may have not realized it.\

` …… I remember Roa's irksome voice.@
` That book---those contents.@
` The book I read when I couldn't sleep.@
` Was it maybe just a dream of mine dreaming that I was awake and couldn't sleep?\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
` …… But you were already insane a long, long time ago……!\

` Roa said such words.@
` DREAM---dream.@
` But, I don't see those kinds of dreams.@
` In the first place, I don't have that strange knowledge inside of me.@
` There's no reason for me to have that dream.@
` That, isn't my dream.\
br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`   You may have not realized it.\

`"----Shut, up."@
br
` *pant* *pant* *pant*
br
` Then what is that?@
` Since when the hell did I start having dreams that belonged to another person?\

br
br
br
br
br
br
br
`    You and I are connected, Shiki.\

`"----Shut up, you're dead."@
` You're already dead, you bastard, so stop your incessant calling out.@
` I'm---different from you.@
` I'm not a killer.@
` I'm just confused by all the after-effects.@
` Since Ciel-senpai came back, I won't allow myself to go mad over something like this.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---Yeah, I also thought so at first.@
`    Even if this Roa came in---\

`"Shiki-sama……!@ What are you doing, Shiki-sama!?"@
` I hear Hisui's voice across the door.@

` Words.@ I can't even remember, my words.@

` As if she was trying to compete with it, Hisui knocks harder on the door.\
