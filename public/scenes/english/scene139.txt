`"What did you want to talk about, Shiki?"@
`"About vampires.@ You said it before.@ That the recent serial killings were the work of a vampire."@
` Arcueid nods.@
`"Then do you know the morning news said another victim was found?@ She was killed last night and drained of blood."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"-----"@
` …… Arcueid's eyes narrow.@
` Something…
` Something like a freezing tension races down my spine.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Oh?@ And?"@
`"And?---you……"@
` I swallow hard.@
` She stares right at me.@
` Almost---a stare which says she will attack me immediately if I move even the slightest bit.\

`"Is---isn't it strange, Arcueid?@
` Nrvnqsr is dead.@ So why are these incidents still happening?@ Don't tell me, that, you---"\
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's not it at all.@ That's not me, but another vampire."@
` Arcueid responds immediately, loosening the tension.@
` But I'm not satisfied.\

`"What do you mean?@ The work of another vampire?@ So they just keep coming?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Of course not.@ The serial killings were always the work of just one vampire from the very beginning.@ So no new vampires will come, and Nrvnqsr was unrelated to those incidents."@
br
` ----Eh?@
` Nrvnqsr was, unrelated……?@
br
`"Wha---what do you mean?"@
`"It's just like I said.@ …… You're normally pretty sharp, but you're lost at some points.@ Think back, Shiki.@ Nrvnqsr was a vampire, but did he ever suck human blood?"\
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


`"Suck blood?@ He ate humans and---oh."\
br
` I see.@
` Why didn't I notice such a simple mistake?@
` The victims of the serial killings are found with their bodies drained of blood.\

` But Nrvnqsr was different.@
` He didn't leave any dead bodies behind.@ He not only drank the blood, but also ate the meat, leaving no trace.@
` To prove it, the people eaten by him in the hotel were treated as missing people, not killed people.@
br
` So---that means, it is something completely different.\

`"Wait.@ Then what is the serial killing going on right now?@ Just who is doing it?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That's a different vampire than Nrvnqsr.@ To be more specific, that vampire is why I came here, and Nrvnqsr came here following me.@ It's that sort of correlation."@
`"---Wha… So the one you're after wasn't Nrvnqsr after all……!?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, I didn't ever say he was my initial target.@
` I was his target, but he was never my target; my target is the one called the 'serial killer' in this city."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t11.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Shiki.@ I don't quite believe it, but don't tell me you made such a simple mistake?"\
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst


`"Wha-----"@
` I gasp in shock.@
` But---it really is just as she says.@
` She said her purpose is to kill vampires, so I just thought it was Nrvnqsr she was after----\
br
`"…… So what is it?@ Killing Nrvnqsr that night, was pointless………!?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"It wasn't pointless, you fought in my place.@ Well, if you didn't kill me, you probably wouldn't have had to in the first place."@
br
`"------"@
` I feel a little dizzy.\

`"…… In other words, those vampire killings had nothing at all to do with Nrvnqsr and it was the work of another vampire……?"@

`"Yeah, that's right.@ But, that's my problem so you don't have to worry about it.@ But more than that, hey."\

` With an extremely happy smile, Arcueid looks up at me as I still stand there in surprise.@

`"How was last night?@ Who came?"\
