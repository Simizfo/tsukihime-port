` …… But I might be overreacting if I go apologize to her.@
` Kohaku-san told me to keep that conversation a secret.@ Besides, considering Akiha, if I apologize to her like "I'm sorry for everything", I can see her getting mad at me.@

`"…… Yeah, I guess I'll wait until lunchtime."@
` I stay in the classroom and get ready for the next period, still feeling a bit unsettled.\

` It's lunchtime.@
` It's like an unspoken agreement, but if I go out to the courtyard, I will end up having lunch with Akiha.@
` …… *sigh*@
` But it's a bit depressing today.@
` I want to apologize about this morning, but I don't have any idea how I can apologize.@

`"Yo, Tohno.@ Let's hurry up and go to the courtyard.@ Akiha-chan is waiting."@
` …… Says one guy.@ Besides, I can't leave her by herself.@
` …………… *sigh*@
` I let out a big sigh and leave the classroom with Arihiko.\

` Akiha isn't here yet.@
` Since Ciel-senpai will be coming too, I guess we'll eat on the grass instead of on the bench.\
