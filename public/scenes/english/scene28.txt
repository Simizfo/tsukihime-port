` The hall during lunchtime is packed.@
` Students head to the cafeteria or to their favorite places, lunches in hand.@
` Caught in the flow of people, I contemplate whether I should go to the cafeteria or the store.@
`"……"@
` I'm taken aback by my own leisure.@
` If I have time to waste here, it'd be better if I go to the cafeteria where Arihiko is.\

` Almost all the seats in the cafeteria are taken.@
` Because I spaced out in the hallway, empty seats are pretty much non-existent at this point.@
br
`"---Aren't there any empty seats?"@
` I cast my gaze over the crowded cafeteria.@
` There shouldn't be any spare seats this late, but I decide to check the tables out anyway.\

`"…… Ah."@
` I'm surprised…… no, I'm astounded.@
` There, plain as day, is a table with not two, not even three, but four unoccupied seats.@
` There are two students sitting at the table, and it seems like one of them noticed me during my efforts to locate a seat.@

`"Yo, Tohno!"@
` The student vigorously waving his hand is my dear classmate with the dyed orange hair.@

`"……"@
` My head hurts.@
` But there isn't anywhere else to sit, so I have no choice but to return the wave and walk towards the table where my friend is sitting.\

` An unexpected person is sitting at the table with him.@
`"Huh, Ciel-senpai?"@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Ah, if it isn't Tohno-kun."@
` We point at each other simultaneously.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Yo, Tohno---hey wait…… Senpai, do you know Tohno?"@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes, I've met him once today already.@ We bumped into each other with a bang today, didn't we, Tohno-kun?"@
`"Ah…… yes, sorry about that."@
` I lower my head in apology.@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Not at all.@ I'm also sorry for spacing out like that.@ You're a serious person, aren't you, Tohno-kun?"@
`"Serious……?@ No, not really."@
` Smiling, Senpai gives a satisfied nod.@
` How should I say this…… Senpai has a unique atmosphere around her.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"But it's sure surprising that Tohno-kun and Inui-kun know each other.@ Could it be that you two are in the same class?"@
`"That's right!@ Me and Tohno are more than casual acquaintances!@ We've been in the same class since our first year, and we've been inseparable best friends since middle school!"@
` My best friend strikes the table with a bang for emphasis.@
` …… Is it just me, or is he more hyper than usual?\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Come on, best friend, sit down!@ If you just keep standing there vacantly, your chikara udon is going to go stale.@ Hurry up and sit down, and let me hear all about how you got to know Senpai."@
` Arihiko slaps my back cheerfully.@
`"……"@
` While I really have no story like Arihiko might be hoping for, there are no other seats available.@
` Reluctantly, I take a seat next to him.\

` It seems Arihiko is close with Senpai.@
` In contrast with me, who's only met her a few times, he's able to talk to her quite casually.@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"By the way, Senpai, you said you ran into Tohno, what happened?"@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Yes, I bumped into Tohno-kun between classes.@ I wasn't hurt, but Tohno-kun bumped his head."@
`"Hmm…… I wouldn't have thought Tohno would do something as clumsy as that.@ This guy may look spaced out, but he's actually an unbelievably sharp guy.@ He doesn't like to depend on others, and he hates causing trouble for others……"\
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Ah, I also got that impression.@ He was only concerned about me when we ran into each other, and he apologized to me just now, too."@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"See?@ That's the kind of guy he is, so he doesn't make those kind of mistakes.@ …… Ah, could it be that your anemia was acting up again?"@
` Arihiko's voice shows his serious concern for my physical health.@

`"…… No, it's not that.@ I was running to the office to deal with some details for me moving.@ That's when I ran into Senpai."@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Really?@ Well, I thought you became careless because you're depressed over the move."@
` Arihiko folds his arms and nods to himself in agreement.\


` ----And then,
br
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t10a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Tohno-kun, are you changing schools!?"@
` Senpai exclaims almost hysterically.\

`"I'm not changing schools, Senpai.@ I'm just changing my place of residence, so I filed the paperwork for a change-of-address."@
ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Eh…… So that means you're going to be living alone?"\
`"No, I'm just going back to my real home.@
` It's that fancy place on top of the hill.@ I still can't quite believe it yet."@
`"Oh…… Could that possibly be the Tohno-san mansion?"\

` Senpai asks with some hesitation.@
` The western-style house on top of the hill is probably seen as something special to the residents of this town.@
` I haven't been there for eight years, but even in my memories, the Tohno mansion was ridiculously large.\

`"Yeah, that's right.@ I don't think it's the right place for me either, but it's too late now that I'm done moving."@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Hmm…… You don't seem too happy about it."@
`"It's not a particularly good or bad thing.@ I don't really understand it myself."@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Well, even if it is your house, it's been eight years, right?@ I can understand if you're feeling restless.@ It'll probably feel like someone else's house for a while."@
`"I wonder if that's so…… I haven't gone back yet, so I don't know.@ Well, I'm a bit relaxed, since I've always got a refuge at your place."\
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Hmph.@ Listen, you, I'm not impressed with how you come to stay at my house every time something bad happens.@ I like your personality trait of not standing out, but I've hated how you're always too reserved for a long time now!"@
` Arihiko strikes the table with a bang again.@
`"……"@
` Well, everything Arihiko said is true, so there's no way to fight back.@


ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Inui-kun, does Tohno-kun really stay at your house that often?"\
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah, he does.@ That damn Tohno is too reserved toward his parents and he would come to my place every long vacation.@ He's reserved towards them cause they're taking care of him.@
` That's why he comes over to my place, where we conveniently have an empty room.@ Since he looks pretty decent, my sister took a liking to him, and he shamelessly comes to stay with us without paying a cent!"@
` Arihiko's fist trembles, as if to say 'unforgivable!'@

ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Taking care of Tohno-kun?"@
`"Ah----"@
` Arihiko clamps a hand over his mouth.@
ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"…… Sorry.@ I should've thought before I spoke."@
`"It's okay.@ You didn't say anything bad."@
` I continue to eat my chikara udon without looking at Arihiko.\

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Really?@ Yeah, you're right.@ If you complain about that, you'll be in for some punishment."@
` Arihiko nods to himself in agreement.@
` His overwhelming optimism is something I am truly envious of.\

ld l,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Tohno-kun, um…… did you not get along with your previous family?"@

ld r,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"No, that's not it.@ This guy had no problem with the Arimas.@ Oh, the Arimas were the family who took care of him.@ They're really nice people, and from what I could see, they're a happy family.@
` Even so, he refused to be their adopted child, and he escaped to my place every vacation.@ Sheesh…… just what were you not satisfied with, anyway?"@
`"There's nothing I wasn't satisfied about.@ It's just that I've received so much from them already, I didn't want to be a further burden on them."\

cl a,%type_crossfade_fst

` …… Senpai drops her shoulders and falls silent.@
` It looks like she's sorry for asking about my family situation.@
`"It's okay, Senpai.@ Sorry for making you listen to something so boring."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Eh, not at all.@ I'm sorry for asking you something so strange, too."@
` Senpai forces herself to look cheerful.@
` The topic might be fine for a long-time friend like Arihiko, but a complex matter like this would only have been troublesome for Senpai.@
` And to prove my point, Senpai sits there uneasily.\

`"Listen, Senpai---"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Um, I've finished eating, so I'll be leaving now.@ I'm really sorry."@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid
` Senpai lowers her head in a quick bow and leaves her seat.@
br
` Only me and Arihiko remain at the table.\

`"…… Sorry.@ You were finally able to eat with just the two of you, but I got in the way."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Don't worry about it.@ That was my fault for not paying attention.@ I thought it was bad for Senpai, actually." …… *slurp* *slurp* *slurp*@
` Arihiko slurps away at his udon.@
` It looks like it's gotten cold while we were talking.@
`"Well, that was convenient for us, anyway.@ I've got something to talk to you about in private, so it was lucky that Senpai left first."\

`"What's wrong?@ Getting all serious all of a sudden.@ I'll tell you now, I don't have any money.@ From today onwards, I'm going to be living life as a penniless youth."@
`"It's not that, damn it.@ What I want to know is this; what's really going on with you, Tohno?"@
`"What do you mean?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ari_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"You've been at the Arimas' since primary school, right?@ I don't know why, but it's been eight years already.@ Your dad has basically disinherited you.@ Why is he calling you back all of a sudden?"@
` …… I see.@
` In his own way, he is worried about me.\

`"He didn't 'disinherit' me.@ He just kicked me out of the house for some reason."@
`"Tohno-kun, if there ever is a house that kicks their child out of their house 'for some reason', that's not a tragedy, it's a comedy. 'Oh, it's a party joke!' But it's so boring, it's not funny."@
` Arihiko spreads his arms and shrugs.@
`"…… Yeah, I guess you're right.@ If you get kicked out of the house, all you can really do is laugh."\

`"And then he said some cliche line like, 'Never step foot in this house again!' or something, right?@ That's what people would call 'disinheritance.'
` Come to think of it, I've never heard why you were disinherited."@
`"……"@
` …………… Who knows?@
` That's something I'd like to know, too.@
`"Well, if you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst

` Grabbing his bowl with both hands, Arihiko drains his cold udon soup.@
` Lunchtime is short.@
` Following Arihiko, I decide to quickly eat my own chikara udon.\
