` ---Something seems… very familiar.\

` An old Japanese-style room.@
` A dark room.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` ---That is,
` that's an extremely old memory.\

` When I was very young, I wasn't used to the new people that took me in, so I locked myself up in my room.@
br
` I didn't care for anything; I didn't want to talk to anyone.@
` Always, always alone, and I wanted to be swaddled in a cradle of my happy memories.\
` Even if I knew there would be nothing like that for me ever again, I still wanted to do so.\

` Knock knock, came a sound.@
`"…… Who is it?"@
`"It's me."@
` Ah, she came again.@
` That girl around my age was knocking on the door again.@
`"SHIKI-chan, let's play.@ You'll get moldy if you stay in a place like that."@
`"I don't wanna.@ I don't like going outside."@
` Hugging my knees, I huddled in a corner of the dark room.\

bg "image\bg\ima_06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


` …… That girl came every day.@
` She would always knock, never getting tired of it.@
` She would never force me out, so she would not open the door, but just continued to call my name.\

`"Why won't you come outside?"@
br
` Because there's no one that I know outside.@ Everyone hates me outside.@
br
`"That's not true.@ Everyone wants to like you, SHIKI-kun."@
br
` Yes.@ I knew that, but I couldn't believe it.@ Because my father went outside, and---\

br
br
br
br
br
` And.@
` He was torn to pieces.\

`"…… I see.@ No wonder you can't trust anyone."@
br
` Yeah, that's why I will always stay here.@ I don't want any more scary things happening.@
br
`"But, you will just be by yourself all the time.@ Being by yourself is no fun."@
br
` Even if it's no fun, it is better than being scared.\

`"That's, that's not fun at all.@ Then, SHIKI-chan, you can believe in me."@
br
` …… You say I can believe in you.@ That's a little backwards.@ Don't people normally say, "I believe you?"@
br
`"It's okay!@ SHIKI-chan, you can trust me and come out!@
br
` …… Fine, but, believe, what should I believe in?\

`"Simple.@ Even if everyone hates you, I will still like you, SHIKI-chan.@ Because I like you, I always come and ask you to play."@
br
` ……… Is outside, fun?@
br
`"Yeah!@ It's much, much more fun than being by yourself-----!"@
