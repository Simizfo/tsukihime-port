` To be honest, Kohaku-san has the hardest job because she has to prepare the feast for the four of us.@
` I don't think I can be that much help in cooking, but I'll go see Kohaku-san.@

` The kitchen has already become a battlefield.@
` On each counter there is a mountain of ingredients, and I get the urge to turn around and go back as soon as I enter.\

` …… After calming down a bit, I realize that the kitchen is actually pretty small for a mansion so large.@
` They probably had a much bigger galley when there were many people living in the mansion, but with just Akiha, Hisui, Kohaku-san and I, they had this smaller kitchen prepared.@

` I don't know whose tastes this is a reflection of, but she hands me an apron that says "Quiet Unsociable Person" on it.\

` Kohaku-san is in a good mood.@
` ----First, I have to take the shells off all these shrimp.\

` Whick, whick, whick.@
` The sound of a knife lightly hitting the cutting board.@
` Nnnnn~.@
` Kohaku-san's humming fills the kitchen.\

` ……@
` …………@
` ………………@
` She must be immersed in cooking because she doesn't say much.@
` As for me, I actually enjoy peeling the shrimp, and keep on peeling the skin.@

`"------"@
` …… You know, this really brings back memories.@
` Before the incident and before I left the mansion, I played like this several times with Kohaku-san and Akiha.\

` We were young then, and we didn't even think about how we were of the opposite gender.\
` We were just in this spacious mansion, and all we knew was the continuous fun of every day.@
` We played around so much, we forgot about all the things that bothered us before.@
` …… Or maybe.@
` Maybe, in order to forget the bothersome past, we tried to pass our days with as much fun as possible.\

`"Eh?@ No, not really, why do you ask?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\koha_t05.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Because you look like you're having so much fun.@ You know Hisui-chan, her eyebrows would always be so scrunched up by the time she gets done."@
`"Really?@ I'm surprised.@ She looks like the type that would do it without complaint."@

`"Yeah, for some reason, Hisui-chan is poor at cooking.@ But she is really great at cleaning and arranging things."@

`"If that was true I would be very happy.@ But both Hisui-chan and I are merely normal, so we have our faults too.@
` Hisui-chan's sense of taste is a little strange, so even when she makes things that she thinks are delicious, for Akiha-sama or I, it tastes really strange."@
` I see, so that's why Hisui doesn't cook.@
` Hisui's sense of taste is a little odd; Kohaku-san…… what's her fault, I wonder?\

`"…… Well, come to think of it, you and Hisui are different in your own ways.@
` Kohaku-san, you were always cheerful, while Hisui stayed in the mansion back then."@
`"Oh, did I look that cheerful?@ I thought I was always watching you all though."@
`"Yeah, I remember.@ You would always run around with us, but you would tell us to stop doing dangerous things and look out for us."\

` …… Ah, I really do remember.@
` Playing tag in the courtyard of the mansion.\
` Trying as hard as we could to catch my old man's carp in the pond.\

`"Hey, remember that time, the time where we left the mansion from the gate, right?@
` We didn't know the way to get back, and you ended up calling the mansion and one of the mansion's servants had to come pick us up."@

`"Yes, and after that Makihisa-sama really did yell at you.@ Everyone was playing with you, but somehow you ended up being the only one.@ We did so many things, but in the end, you always saved Akiha-sama and me from getting in trouble."@

` She giggles as she speaks aloud nostalgically.\

`"…… What's this?@ Talking about old times, I really feel like I have returned now."@
` That's right.@
` I really don't have too many memories of this mansion, but talking about old times honestly makes me feel nostalgic.@
` But, my memories aren't just happy ones.\

`"…… But, I did treat Hisui poorly."@
` …… That girl who was always in the corner of my heart.@
` In the end, I was never able to have a true conversation with that girl by the window.@
`"…… That girl, she was always watching us from the window.@ Always, it struck me.@ That lonely face looking down, I always thought it would be great if she could come and play."@
` But still, before I left the mansion, she gave me that one parting gift.\

`"That's right.@ She was always shy even then, so I never knew what she was thinking.@ I always thought if Hisui-chan was happy, it wouldn't matter what happened to me."@
`"Oh?@ Kohaku-san, you really are a good older sister."@
` I'm feeling happy, so I give an answer like that.@

`"Ah."@

` All of a sudden,
` with a short sound, Kohaku-san lifts her hand.@
` I can see she cut her finger with the kitchen knife.\

`"Ah, that's true."@
`"'That's true'?@ Hey, Kohaku-san!?"@
` I don't believe this.@
` Even I could see that the cut is really deep, but Kohaku-san is still slow-paced.\

`"How embarrassing.@ I am supposed to be such a good chef.@ Ahaha!"@
` Kohaku-san gives her normal laugh.@
`"This is no laughing matter.@ We have to take care of it right away……!"@
`"It's fine.@ It isn't life threatening or anything."@
`"But doesn't it hurt?@ It's cut pretty bad!"\

`"No, not at all.@ If I think it doesn't hurt, then it won't hurt.@ If I think this isn't my finger, and that it's just a finger of some doll, then I won't feel pain, right?"@
`"Wha----"@
` With a smile, Kohaku-san says something pretty outlandish.@
` Well I'm sure if you think that way, it won't hurt as much, but you can't get rid of it all.\

`"Look, let's just get it taken care of!@ I'm a little weak when it comes to blood, so if I have an anemic fit right here, it'll be your fault, Kohaku-san……!"@
`"I see, then I should take care of it right away.@ Well then, Shiki-san, excuse me for a moment."@
