`"---You finally decided to fight."@
` Her voice seems almost relieved.\

`"That's good.@ Now there is no sin for either of us.@
` Now that we are both trying to kill each other, our sin will die.@ Now there is only punishment for the one who lives."@
` …… Since we are both trying to kill each other there is no sin?@
` Her words are part of a world I can't understand.\

`"I see.@ Then is that punishment for the one that's left alive atoneable?"@
`"Yes.@ Something that is atoneable is what we call punishment.@ If it is called punishment, there is no reason for it not to be atoneable.@ The only thing that does not disappear is the sin.@
` So---we don't want to carry that burden, do we?"@
` Saying that,
` she takes another step forward.\

`"--Then, killing you here isn't a sin, Senpai?"@
`"Yes.@ I will kill you, so it is okay for you to kill me, Tohno-kun.@ Our conditions are equal."@
` Another step.\

`"--------"@
` That's, not right.@
` Certainly I am getting killed, so I'm killing her back to protect my own life.@
` But to say there's no sin---what would happen to Ciel?@
` From the beginning, she came here with an unrequited will to kill.@
br
` That is---\

`"Farewell.@ Let us lower the curtain on this ridiculous play."@

` Her readied bayonet shoots toward my heart.@

` ---I didn't think I could kill her.@
br
` It's only natural for her to pierce my heart before I get within knife range.@
` That's why I was surprised.@
` I easily dodged her blade and was able to pierce her "point" with ease.@
`"----Sen, pai."@
` It looked like she accepted my knife on purpose.\

`"I made you… kill… me."@
` Her faint, weak voice on the verge of death.\

`"That was, my, greatest sin."\

` Sounding like she's crying, she uses her remaining strength to stab me with her bayonet.\

`"------Ga, hu."@
` My blood flow reverses through my lanced heart.@
` Coughing up blood, I collapse onto the ground.@
br
` Before my eyes,
` the body of the one who died slightly ahead of me lies on the floor.\

`"----How--"@
` Did you, know?@
`"----foolish."@
` Did you know from the beginning---that if there was such a thing as sin, it would only be for you?\

`"Ha----ah."@
` The sensation in my limbs fades away.@
` My consciousness, too.@ It will be seconds before I bleed to death.@
` The instant I was stabbed,
` I had a vision of something like an old book, scattering and crumbling away page by page.@
br
` Probably, with that, the thing called Roa was dispersed.\

`"…………"@

` From the very beginning, she planned to give her life to take mine.@
` Did she think that was her punishment?@
br
` ---How foolish.@
` There's no---meaning in that.@
br
`"---Still."@
` I was sad that she died before she apologized to me.\

` If she could have apologized to me, then I bet she would have felt some relief…… But, she couldn't even say that.@
` Since she knew it was something that wasn't atoneable by apology, she didn't apologize to the very end.@
br
` That determination.@ It makes me angry that I made her go that far.\

`"What.@ In the end----"@
` I liked her?@
` Until the very end.@
` Feeling sad like this until my own death, she was that dear to me.\

`"------Tss."@
` I cough weakly and spit out blood.\
