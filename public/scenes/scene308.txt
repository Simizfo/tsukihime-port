` After walking down the usual road and entering the usual alley, I come out to a strange place.@
` I never knew this place was on the way back from school to the mansion.@
` A clearing.@
` There's no walls around, but I don't feel anyone else around here.@
` It's so quiet that it feels like this is the only place in the world, and in it, someone sits on a bench reading a book.\

`"--------"@
` A man with long, golden hair and small, round glasses.@
` With deep, chiseled features and golden hair, there's no doubting that he's a foreigner.@
` Despite his very set features, there is an atmosphere of softness to him.@
` Even though he looks cold-hearted, his eyes seem gentle.@
` …… It's probably because of that.@
` So, I talked to this strange person.\

` After looking up, he asks me what I want.@
` I inquire what he was doing.@
` With a smile, he says that just like it appears, he is reading a book.@
` I then ask if it is interesting.@
` With a terribly kind smile, he declares that nothing is interesting at all.@
br
` He stands up.@
` He leaves the old book that he was reading on the bench.\

` I call out to him.@
` I tell him he forgot his book.@
` Over his shoulder, he says that he is done reading it.@
br
` The pages of the book are flipping.@
` Even though there is no wind.@
` The pages unbind, and page by page, they fly far away as if they were disappearing into nothingness.@
br
` As if hiding in the paper storm, the man's figure starts to fade away.@
` I ask where he's going, but he just responds that he never was anywhere to begin with.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
` There is only an observer which reads the book.@
` If the book ceases to exist, the observer also ceases to exist.\

` At last, all the pages fly away and the book becomes nothing.@
` The man's figure is obviously nowhere to be seen.@
bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_crossfade_slw

` If that's the case, it's no surprise the memories which do not belong to me of this place also disappear.@
` The book carrying the memories of long reincarnation disappears.@
` And the vampire called Roa gracefully dies after eight hundred years.\
