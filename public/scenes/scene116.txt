` I head up the road and draw near the mansion.@
` After a little more walking, I see Hisui standing by herself at the front gate.@
br
`"……?@ I wonder what Hisui is doing?"@
` Tilting my head to the side, I head for the front gate.@
` Hisui realizes I'm here and bows her head.\

`"Welcome back, Shiki-sama."@
`"---Ah, yeah---thanks, Hisui."@
` I can barely reply since I'm bewildered by the respectfulness of it all.@
`"Um---were you waiting for me to come home?"@
`"Yes.@ Greeting the master is a servant's duty."@
` Answering very matter-of-factly, she doesn't even bat an eyelash.\

`"Um, Hisui, I'm truly happy you waited to greet me, but there's really no need to wait outside.@
` I'll come back on my own, so you can just greet me whenever you realize I'm back."@

`"-----"@
` Hisui's face clouds slightly.@
` …… Oh, maybe…
` Maybe she was waiting for me to return like this on Saturday and Sunday.\

`"--Hisui, um--"@

`"I understand.@ Starting from tomorrow, I will await your return in the lobby."@
` Hisui gives a quick bow and opens the mansion gate.@
` Hisui turns around as she does so.\

` ………… *sigh*@
` For some reason, the atmosphere isn't exactly conducive to conversation.@
` Hisui closes the gate after I pass through, then she silently walks to the entrance to open the door and leads me into the lobby.\

` I get to my room.@
` Akiha isn't back yet from her lessons, Kohaku-san is preparing dinner, and Hisui is cleaning the mansion.@
br
`"---Geez, there's nothing to do."@
` Well, there's quite a mountain of studying, reviewing, and memorizing a student like me has to do.@
` But, I just don't feel like doing anything.\

` Suddenly, Arcueid's face flashes in my mind.@
` Whether good or bad, it's probably just a reaction to the crazy two days I just had.@
` Perhaps spacing out here in my room will be good, giving my mind and heart a break.\

` After eating dinner by myself in the large dining room, Kohaku-san treats my wounds and I go back to my room.@
` Akiha didn't make it back in time for dinner.@ Her lesson was apparently going to last a while, so she was going to eat away from home.@
` It's past ten at night now.@
` It's a bit too early, but since I'm exhausted, I should sleep early tonight--\
