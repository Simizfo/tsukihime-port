` So I took to keeping a diary like my old man.@
` I cut a few snippets out of my old man's to give it some character and a starting point.@
` 
` January 4th, 199X --
` 
` Had a rather heavy case of dementia today, so I planted my stiffy inside Kohaku and watched some TV.@ She didn't seem that happy about it… or happy about anything really.@ Oh well.@
` Oh!@ 3rd quarter results came out today, looks like I saved a mint by pulling out of Yakazuki Manufacturing.
` 
`   --Makihisa\
` January 7th, 199X --
` 
` She sure loves scribbling in that diary of hers.@ Also, had to hide all of the letter openers today.@ She keeps looking at them funny.
` 
`   --Makihisa\
bg "image\bg\cmo_15.jpg",%type_crossfade_slw
` November 3rd, 200X --
` 
` Had another alley dream last night.@ Remember to tell gardener to kill Kohaku's 'flowerbed' and salt the earth.@
` 
` Possibly related: There was a murder in town last night.
` 
`   --Shiki\
` November 4th, 200X --
` 
` Break from school today.@ Gardener was mowing, so I sat back in my room and watched Kohaku gather up the grass clippings for compost.@ Was going fine until the lawnmower swerved around one of those decorative stones, right into where Kohaku was raking…@
` 
` I heard the buzzing sound from where I was; mentally prepared for the worst.@
` 
` The gardener jumped off of the lawnmower, screaming and hollering.@ Kohaku merely dropped the rake and stared at the stump where her foot had been, then balanced unsteadily on the remaining one as the gardener began to empty his stomach into a nearby bush.\
` To make things worse, Hisui came in right while it was happening…@ Changing the sheets or something.@
` 
` I nodded to her, still watching like a voyeur.@ By then, the gardener was screaming into a cell phone…@ Kohaku meanwhile wobbled like a girl playing hopscotch, trying to pick up the rake at her foot without losing balance.@ Naturally, Hisui asked what I was looking at.@
` 
` I tried to shrug it off, told her Kohaku just lost a foot to the mower.@ Hisui went pale, so then I had to try to calm her down.\
` Looked back out the window, said something like,
` 
`"Uh, it's being taken care of.@ Besides, you know.@ She doesn't let little things like that get in the way of her cheerful outlook."@
` No response.@
` 
` I looked back to see Hisui passed out on the bed in shock.@
` 
` Honestly, it's like it was her own damn foot.@ I mean, Kohaku wouldn't let a little thing like having a foot lopped off distract her from her true purpose.@
` At least it'll make it harder for her to pretend to be Hisui…@ I can already imagine it, "Hisui, chop off your foot. Please? It's the only way I can protect you."
` 
`   --Shiki\
bg "image\bg\bg_40c.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` December 10th, 200X --
` 
` New gardener has worse luck than the previous one…@ Kohaku lost her other foot to the lawnmower yesterday.@ Seemed generally unphased and genial, even when pressured.@
` She didn't even say anything about it until I slipped on the puddle of gore coming back from school…@
` 
` Gave her a piggy-back ride to the hospital, since she's the only one with a license.@
` 
` Related: Need to buy new slacks.@ Current pair has blood running down the legs.\
` 
` Had the strangest conversation when I questioned her, too:@
`"No, Shiki-sama.@ This is nothing.@ The doll is just a little… damaged."@
` The entire time, she balanced precariously on her prosthetic and pushed the leaves around the garden with that damned broom.@ Have to admit, though……@ She's getting good at sweeping again.\
` 
`"Uhhhh… Right, uhm…@ You remember when I used to carry His--uh… you… around on piggy back when we were kids?@ You always thought it was so fun to just let me run around with her on my back like that.@ Do you want to try it, Kohaku?@ For old times sake?"@
` 
`"Oh, I do remember that thing you just said!@ Let's try it!@ Please?"@
`
` ………@
` 
` Was nostalgic, though……@ Reminded me of of playing 'hospital' at the Arima house.@ Everyone would pick me up, throw me in the car, and drive to the hospital as fast as they could.
` 
`   --Shiki\
` December 17th, 200X --
` 
` Woke up covered in blood in the alleyway again.@ Wasn't naked this time, so I must have done something to please Kohaku.@ Was slightly hard making it back to the mansion last time while wearing nothing but a copy of the Sunday Times.@
` 
` The new gardener quit.@ Requesting worker's comp.@ Flowerbed remains.@
` 
` Reminder: Ask Akiha if the Tohno Family has any strong military connections.@ After seeing what happened to that gardener, maybe napalm from a fast moving military airplane would be a safer method to get rid of those flowers.
` 
`   --Shiki\
` January 4th, 200X --
` 
` Personal note: Stop accepting drugs from 'Hisui'.@ I can't tell the damn difference between them.@ Maybe if I could get Kohaku's contacts I would stand a chance, but she keeps hiding them all over…@
` And then she only gives me that freaky grin AFTER I've taken the offered drug.@ That glassy-eyed expression turns my spine to ice and makes my testicles recede into my body for fear.
` 
`   --Shiki\
` January 5th, 200X --
` 
` Had another 'alleyway' dream, woke up in Akiha's room without clothes and covered head to toe in blood.@ Mostly sure that none of it was mine.@ Can't for the life of me figure out how Kohaku got the Morning Glory to me this time.
` 
`   --Shiki\

` (Reed Warbler Shiki diary)
` Month X Day x --
` 
` Walked in for nightly feeding to find Akiha sitting on Kohaku's stomach, chewing on one of her arms.@ I guess I shouldn't have gone to get that transfusion today.@ I can only assume that they've been that way since Kohaku went in this morning to comb Akiha's hair.@ Swatted her back with a broom, then gave her a stern talking-to as she drank about a pint out of my jugular.@
` Upon regaining consciousness, Kohaku said something about a doll again, apologized profusely and then scuttled off like a cockroach.@
` 
` And everyone thinks *I'm* strange.
` 
`   --Shiki\
` Month X Day x --
` 
` Late for the feeding again.@ Kohaku had taken cover in the closet.@ Akiha was banging on it half-heartedly, growling, and trying to figure out how to open it.@ She had the cutest primal expression on her face.@
` Like, "How I get in. Blood in there."@
` Kohaku called from the closet, "Oh, Shiki-san, it's okay.@ It's only been a few hours!"@ Must remember to dock her pay for loitering around like that…@
` 
` Reminder: Find out if we even *pay* Hisui and Kohaku.
` 
`   --Shiki\
` Month X Day x --
` 
` Woke up late today, Hisui was worried about Kohaku and had not seen her since morning duty with Akiha.@ Stumbled out of bed and over to the detached building to find Akiha knocking on the closet door.@
` Called for Kohaku, only to get an apology for not having breakfast ready, spoken from inside the closet.@ Distracted Akiha with a cowbell and sent Kohaku back to the manor.@
` 
` Reminder: Talk to Kohaku about morning duties, Akiha's hair was a positive mess again.

` ------Suddenly, I wake up.\

bg "image\bg\ima_21.jpg",crossfade_fst



` A vast night.@
` In the midst of a grassy field that extends as far as the eye can see, I stare blankly at the moon.@
` There is no one else here.@
` No signs of human presence; no sounds from any animals.@
` Maybe it's because I've pushed myself too hard these past couple of days.@
` I just wanted to lie down quietly and be alone, but it seems I fell asleep.\


` It was a bright darkness.@
` Probably because the moon is hanging so low.@
` The grassy field that looked like a black sea last night is bright, like some sort of a stage.@
` A clearing illuminated by sharp, sharp moonlight.@
br
` I thought it was like a theater somewhere.@
br
` Only, there are no curtains around.@
` This field that sweeps far and wide is devoid of any curtains of trees, nor is there an audience or stage crew.\


` There's nothing here.@
` The only things here are the moonlight and the white darkness.@
` The wind does not blow and the grass does not even sway.@
!w1000
br
` ----How quiet.@
br
` I laugh quietly as it feels like all the commotion until yesterday was just a joke.@
` No, if you talk about jokes,
` then my life until now was so happy that, looking back at it, it seems like it was just an illusion.\


` A lot of things have happened.@
` There were a lot of amazing things that occurred, and my life changed pace quite often.@

` The expected, and the unexpected.@
br
` Everything was illusory.@
` Looking back, it seems that no matter how trivial things seemed, all those coincidences built on each other.@
` The days were only a repetition of each other, but no two days were quite the same.@
` Then, that means…
` Perhaps each and every one of them was an irreplaceable moment I can never return to.\


` I recall many things that happened.@
` The memories are so nostalgic, it makes me smile.@
` Just the thought of the new experiences awaiting me in the future, different from those of my past, makes me dizzy.@
br
` Truly a mix of emotions.@ Happiness, excitement, and enough worries to give me a headache.@
br

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",crossfade_fst

` ------Thump.@
br
` My heart beats loudly once.\


` What comes after is my usual anemia.@
` The dizziness continues for a while, but eventually disappears.\

` Even though the wound on my chest healed, my anemia didn't go away.@
` It seems like my fragile health wasn't caused by the wound on my chest alone.@
br
` …… Well, of course.@
` Being able to perceive the shape of death means I stand much closer to death than others.@
` To be honest, I never thought about living a long life, like ordinary people.\


` Thump.@ The sound of my heart beating.@
` It's not like me to think of this, but I wonder just how long I can keep running through time.@
` The conclusion is rather uninteresting.@
br
` Because, even if it stops tomorrow, or in a few decades, still----\

`"Hey you.@ It's dangerous just lying around like that."@
br
` ----And.@
br
` I hear a familiar voice.\

`"Eh…?"@
`"What do you mean, 'eh'?@ You have an awful lot of free time on your hands if you can just sleep around here in the middle of the night.@ I was this close to kicking you, so you better watch out."@
` She says this grumpily while carrying a trunk in one hand.\

`"Oh…?@ Kicked?@ And by who?"@
` I lift myself up.@
`"Isn't it obvious, stupid?@ You and I are the only ones here, so who else could it be but me?"@
` She declares this confidently as she folds her arms.@
`"Ha-------"@
` Stifling the laughter spilling out of me, I gaze up at her and the moon.\

`"I can't believe it… I somehow felt that I'd meet you, but I didn't think that day would be today."@
`"What a coincidence.@ I didn't expect to see you here, either.@
` I heard you were here, but we never did meet up, did we?@ So I was thinking that it was our fate this time not to meet.@ Although…"@
`"If we did see each other, it would have caused trouble, right?"@
`"Right.@ I am a member of the Association, after all.@ We're not quite on good terms with The Church."@
` She laughs without any hint of guilt.@
` It really is hard holding back my laughter.@
` It makes me happy that this person hasn't changed one bit since that day we met.\

`"And, since I ran out of things to do, I was going to leave here tomorrow.@
` See, this incident was partially my fault, you know?@ So, I stopped by here for a final check, and I almost ended up kicking some ordinary person."@
`"Then… we were fated to meet.@ To be honest, I felt we would meet up again."@
` I smile.@
`"You're right.@ I welcome this sort of fate."@
` She flashes me an identical smile in return.\

br
br
br
br
br
br
`"Long time no see.@ You've grown up, Shiki."@
`"Yes.@ You seem to be doing well too, Sensei."@
br
` Returning her plain greeting, I look back at Sensei with serious eyes.\

` We sit in the field of grass and talk.@
` We talk about senseless things, just like the old days.@
` It was only briefly that we talked about what had happened and what we were going to do in the future.\

`"It's about time.@ I don't plan on staying here long.@ I'm leaving before dawn, so we'll have to part here."@
` Saying that, Sensei stands up.@
` I try to stand up with her… but I collapse.\

`"…… Shiki?"@
` I can hear her voice.@
` I take a few deep breaths and stand back up.@
`"…… Dang.@ It seems like no sleep or rest until last night just hit me."@
`"Looks like it.@ That dizziness is your biggest weakness.@
` You don't look like you have any injuries.@ Is your body alright?"@
`"Yeah, thanks.@ Unlike you, I have a normal body."@
`"Hmm… If you say so."@
` She glances at me meaningfully, then looks directly into my eyes.\


`"----Shiki… You know you're not going to last much longer?"@
br
` Her clear words.@
`"---------"@
` I'm surprised.@
` It's not that I'm surprised by her words, but rather, I never thought she would say them.\

`"----Well, yeah… I kind of know about it already."@
`"Is that so?@ But you seem pretty calm.@
` Even now, you strain your body over something that has nothing to do with you.@
` I would have a hard time believing it, but are you really not afraid of dying?"@
` She stares at me, somewhat peeved.\

`"No way.@ I think I'm more afraid of death than most people."@
br
` But… that's something in the future.@
` It may be tomorrow or next year, but I can't think about the future too much.@
br
`"I can't think about the future too much.@ I prioritize what I want to be doing now."\


`"I see, so you can see your own death as well.@ That's why you're more afraid of death than others.@
` That makes sense… Even for me, I'd be shivering if I could see the thirteen steps to the gallows."@
`"No, it's not like that.@ It's not like I can clearly sense when I'll die."\

`"It's almost the same thing.@ Let's see… can I ask you something, for reference?@
` You ended up with a body weaker than those of others.@ It would only be natural to curse it and fear your life.@
` Hey, Shiki.@ Don't you find it difficult living life with such a body?"@
` Sensei looks at me openly, yet with unreadable eyes.@
` Those are the eyes of a magus, her side of which I'm not familiar with.\

`"---Isn't that right…?@ You can no longer have 'normal' happiness like everyone else.@ As long as you have that body of yours, all that awaits is suffering."@
`"-----That may be so… but…"@
` I think it's not that bad.@
`"But, I'm probably happy.@
` Because up until now was a lot of fun.@ So, it'll probably be fun in the future, too."@
`"-------------"@
` The sound of her gasping.@
` With a large sigh, she changes back to her usual self.\

`"Shiki."@
` She seems sad as she calls my name.@
`"To be honest, I do feel some regret.@
` I feel like I said something to you that I shouldn't have back then."@
` I look straight into her eyes.@
` It's different from before… Back then I had to look up to see her eyes, but now she is looking up into mine.\

`"God doesn't give excessive power without reason.@ And I told you that if you have that power, there has to be some meaning to it.@
` But, you know, it's up to the individual to decide what that meaning may be.@ There's no room for anyone else, especially something as ambiguous as a god, to interfere.@
` So it would have been alright if you did nothing.@
` Even if you denied those eyes of yours and did nothing, it still would have been alright.@
` I'm regretting my words, because… you could have lead a normal life more suitable for you, as Shiki."@
`"……………… Sensei."\

`"Didn't I tell you earlier that you should live your life with an honest heart?@ You really did, Shiki.@
` But, that's something difficult to do.@
` It would have been easier for you to stray from your path a little, because your eyes draw you to disaster.@
` …… Isn't it ironic that a killer more skilled than anyone else also hates killing more than anyone else?@
` If you lived a normal life, or had your heart deviated from the true path, you wouldn't have had to go through so much pain."\

`"Yeah… that may be true, now that you mention it.@ If I gave up, it may have been a little easier.@
` But, that has no meaning.@ It would have only made things a little easier, and to start out with, I never thought of it as particularly painful.@
` You have the wrong idea, Sensei.@ Everything I did, I did because I wanted to.@ It's not like I'm a saint or anything.@
` I like myself just the way I am.@
` That's why… I was glad that you told me back then to become an adult by living just the way I was.@
` Sensei.@ I don't regret anything, so there's no reason for you to regret anything either."\


` I really feel that from the bottom of my heart, and I smile at her.@
` As if dazzled by a radiant light, she narrows her eyes, then closes them briefly.\

`"-----I see……
` Man, it seems you really have become a wonderful young fellow."@
` Her hand reaches for her trunk.\

`"Yeah, you're fine just the way you are, Shiki.@
` …… My world is full of devious individuals, so associating with someone like you balances things out.@ It might be hard on you, but if you don't mind, then I guess it's alright."@
br
` With a "see you," Sensei turns her back to me.\

`"-------------"@
` I can't stop her, and there's no reason to.@
` I can feel that this really is the last time.@
` …… All I can remember is the one thing I forgot to say.@
br
` That day.@
` In an ocean of grass, an important friend who had spoken with me, who was about to disappear.\

`"-------------"@
` There's no wind.@
` The grass does not sway and the only thing that changes is her figure, which gets farther away.@
` She didn't turn around suddenly back then, and she won't now.\

`"------Sensei."@
br
` I call out to stop her.@
` She halts in her tracks.@
`"What?"@
` She doesn't turn around.@ Only her voice drifts to me.\

`"-------------"@
` I know what I must say.@
` The words I've always wanted to say.@
` It's just that… if I say these words, I really won't be able to see her ever again.@
` But still---I have to say them.\

` She told me, "All I'm saying is live true to yourself, and become a man in the manner that you think is right."@
` She also taught me that it is important to accept my mistakes, and to be able to apologize for them.\

` That's why.@
` That's why I have to say it.@
br
br
br
br
`"----Thank you.@ I'm glad I met you, Sensei."\

` …… That's what I felt as a child.@
` Those words were the ones from the bottom of my heart that I once could not say, because I was filled with the sadness of parting.\



` From behind, it seems Sensei is surprised.@
` She stands there, lowers her head, and turns toward me with her usual expression.\
