` I can't do anything she doesn't want again.@
` Once, I gave in to this headache and I killed her.@
br
` That's why, never again.@
` I can't lose to myself and make Arcueid cry.@ Even if this headache tears me apart, I won't do it----\

`"Ha----ah!"@
` I pull back from her body.@
` The headache disappears and my heart returns to normal.@
` The urges rampaging inside me have also disappeared and I finally start to comprehend what I just did.\

`"----What----have I…"@
` I can't believe it.@
` But the memory is all too clear.@
` How I pushed her down.@
` How I choked her and held my knife over her.@
` …… and the disgraceful things I did afterwards.\

`"------"@
` I don't know what to say.@
` Arcueid adjusts her clothes and stands up.@
` I----don't know how to apologize.@
` Just saying sorry… how can that make it up?@
`"----Arcueid, I----"@

`"Don't worry about it…… I'm the one who should apologize."@
` She looks away uncomfortably.\

`"Wha--what are you saying?@ I was the one who did something wrong.@ If only----I had been stronger, that never would have happened."@

`"No.@ I don't think it was something you could have resisted because you saw my 'Mystic Eyes'."@
`"Eh----?@ Mystic Eyes?@ Like, Nrvnqsr's eyes……?"\

`"…… Exactly.@ I wasn't sane earlier.@ I was so thirsty, I couldn't control myself.@
` That's why----I found some of The Dead, and tried to replace that urge with the urge to destroy to stave it off.@
` Back then, I was unable to hold myself back----so that's why you saw my Mystic Eyes when you came."@
`"…… Certainly I felt odd from the time I saw your golden eyes----but that's just that.@ I, with my own will--"\

`"No, that's wrong.@
` Shiki, my Mystic Eyes of Enchantment completely captivate whoever looks upon them.@ …… I think that's why you started to feel all those sexual desires."@
`"--That----can't be right."@
` Because even if she wasn't controlling me.@
` I, I might, still like her.\

`"Anyway, this was all because of my carelessness.@ …… I'm sorry, Shiki.@ I manipulated your body without any regards to your feelings."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` Her gaze shifts away as she says this.@
` …… Being apologized to like this hurts my heart.@
` Because I didn't feel like I was manipulated at all.@
` Rather----it seems like I used it to obey my own lust.\

`"Arcueid, I----"@

`"Don't apologize.@ …… Shiki, this was all an accident.@ I'll forget about it, so please forget about it too.@ I think it's better for the both of us that way."@

` Saying that, she starts to walk quietly.\

`"…… Arcueid……?"@

`"----I think this is enough for tonight.@ I killed all these Dead tonight, so it's probably useless to search any further."@
`"…… That's fine, but what do we do with that mountain of dead bodies?@ If someone finds it, there'll be trouble."@
`"There's no need to worry.@ Once something becomes a vampire and dies, it won't leave a trace.@ Those who refused to return to the Earth become ash to be scattered in the wind once they die.@ They will return and disperse on their own in a while."\

` Without turning around, she disappears from the alley with weak steps.@
`"………………"@
` I can't stop her now.@
` I still feel the sensation of Arcueid on both my hands.\

`"----Idiot.@ What a stupid idiot I am."@
` I groan to myself.@
` In the alley which became a stage of tragedy, I look up at the moon in remorse.\
