` I forgot because she started telling me to take her out to play, but there was something I had to ask her about.\

`"Then I'll ask.@ Arcueid, I was attacked two nights ago by a strange person."@
`"Eh?@ A strange person?@ What kind?"@
`"Well, that is----"@
` I calm down and I describe as clearly as I can what happened two nights ago.\

`"…… Yeah, that's how it was------"@
` Finishing my explanation, I read Arcueid's expression.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` From when I started until now, her eyes remained sharp without any gentleness.\

`"So what is it Arcueid?@ That bandaged man, and that person wearing those robes like some priest, are they enemies of yours?"@
`"…… Yes.@ Both of them are 'enemies'.@ I don't know just who or what that bandaged man is, but that woman wearing those Catholic robes, I have an idea about."@
` She narrows her eyes as if she was in a bad mood.@
` No, she looks less like she was in a bad mood and more like she's irritated.\

`"I may know the person who helped you, Shiki.@ …… Man.@ If it's really her, she'll probably be able to find the enemy before me."@
` She bites her lip vexedly.\
`"Wait a minute.@ I didn't say that person was a woman though."@
`"No, there's no mistake.@ That woman is the only agent given authority to hunt heretics alone and who uses Black Keys that combine the Cremation Rite and the Steel Shell Effect."\

` Her irritability is almost like hostility.@
` Even when she spoke about Nrvnqsr, her voice was never saturated with emotion to this extent.\

`"…… Arcueid.@ Um, that person who helped me, is she a vampire……?"@
`"No, that's not it----that's right, I have yet to tell you about something else that's very important."\

`"I think I explained it before, but vampires like the one making his lair in this town turn humans into their minions and expand their territory.@ At the same time, they try their utmost to conceal their existence.@
` Even though victims appear, they use various magical techniques to make things appear not out of the ordinary.@
` You know why?"\

`"…… Well, it's because humans aren't stupid.@ If they find out monsters like that exist where they live, they'd attack them.@ Even though humans are weak, they do have things like police, so they might be able to do something."@
`"---Well, I guess that's true, but police are only a law-enforcement group against humans.@ We don't consider them at all.@
` But, it's correct to say that vampires hide their presence for the sake of self-preservation."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki, there is a natural enemy of the vampires.@ A group of something like professional killers that now have the power balance in their favor.@
` …… It's true for other transcendent species, but especially for vampires, it is fatal for them to reveal themselves.@
` Even if a vampire made a secret kingdom in a village somewhere in the mountains away from all civilization, this natural enemy would definitely notice if victims keep increasing.\

` Vampires exploit the humans in secret, for no reason other than self-preservation.@
` The vampires hide their dead victim's bodies, not out of fear of human society finding out, but in fear of these natural enemies discovering them."@
`"…… Huh?@ The natural enemy of vampires?@ Yet another group of monsters I don't know about."@
br
` For a normal guy like me, I just want all these unnatural things to stop appearing.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"What are you saying?@ Their natural enemy is without a doubt you humans."@
`"-----?@ Natural enemies, us?"@
`"Yeah.@ Starting from a long time ago, humans used many kinds of magic, the occult, magical ceremonies to create an organization and started to eliminate primates other than humans.@
` The greatest of these is Christianity---the pride of the Vatican, the Exorcists.@ The Catholic Church always viewed "nonhumans" as impurities, but vampires are considered the most dangerous."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t07.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

` "There are many religious groups in the world, but the Catholic Church looks at vampires with more hostility than the rest.@
` You know, it's almost an obsession.@ They are so insane, I don't even want to mess with them."@
` Arcueid lets out a sigh.\

`"The one who helped you was a member of an elite organization that hunts heretics.@
`"This group, the Burial Agency, is part of The Church.@ They use their own strength rather than law to deal with contradictions to Christianity.@ These hidden exorcists are more like professional killers."@
`"…………"@
` Priests that go around exterminating vampires, huh?@
` It's so fitting, I'm not really sure what to say.\

`"Then aren't they like us?@ If this Burial Agency is a group whose purpose is to hunt vampires too, can't we search together?"@
`"----That won't work.@ For them, it's enough that someone is a vampire.@
` To them, non-human primates are just "Evil".@ It doesn't matter if they suck blood or not.@
` This exorcist may have even come here just to seal me rather than fight the vampire who lives in this city."\


`"………………"@
` Things have gotten quite complicated.@
` Arcueid's enemy is sought after by both a vampire, and a group that hunts vampires.@
`"…… What is this?@ Then you're all by yourself?"@
`"Yes, that is the life of a vampire.@
` Didn't Nrvnqsr say so himself?@ Even though vampires belong in the same species, their natures are so different that in the end, they are all alone."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` Arcueid takes another bite of her hamburger.\

` She speaks of being all alone so casually.@
`"…………"@
` Not feeling satisfied, I continue to listen with a sour expression.\
