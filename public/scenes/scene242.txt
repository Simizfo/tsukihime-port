` ----I don't know.@
br
` I was so intent on looking for Yumizuka until this evening.@
` But with nightfall, the events of last night suddenly appear fresh in my mind.@
` The dead bodies scattered about the alley.@
` Yumizuka, who said she killed them.@
` …… No matter what the reason, she killed them.\
` So I understand that staying out of it is the best choice.\

`"……………"@
` I understand, but I can't cast aside my doubts.@
` What am I thinking?@ It's just foolish.@
` I just can't comprehend what's happening to Yumizuka.@
` I do realize she is the vampire serial killer causing all these incidents in town.@
br
` But still,
` I can't forget her last words she said in the sunset on our way home----\

` …… Before I realize it, it's almost midnight.@
` Lost in thinking about what I should do, I've passed some of the night wide awake.@

`"…… Shiki-sama, are you awake……?"@
` …… Hisui's voice.@
` Why is she up this late at night?@

`"I'm up, but why, Hisui?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t01.jpg",%type_tshutter_fst

`"---Yes, I was unsure, but if you were awake, I thought that I should tell you."\

`"Tell me what?"@
`"Just a while ago, a call came for you, Shiki-sama.@ The message was that 'I'll be waiting in the park.'"@
`"Phone call…… This late at night?"@
`"Yes, the call ended before I could ask for a name, so I was unsure if I should tell you, Shiki-sama--"\
`"No--that is……"@
` …… This doesn't require any thought.@
` That phone call had to have been from Yumizuka.\

`"…… Thanks.@ But, it's a little late, so I'll wait until tomorrow.@ She's one of my classmates, so I'll see her tomorrow."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t17.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"That is not true.@ There is something wrong with smiling like that with such a strained face."\
`"Stupid, I'm not lying at all.@ I'm fine, I won't go out this late at night.@ Akiha would get mad, and you would get in trouble, so there's no reason for me to do that."@
`"…………………"@
` Hisui descends into silence.@
` The conversation between us dies.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\his_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Shiki-sama.@ Please do not push yourself too hard."@
`"…… Nah, I'm not pushing anything.@ I'll go to sleep, so please go back to your room."@
`"…………………"@
` Hisui just looks at me.@
`"---Well, good night."@
` Not being able to endure her stare, I slam the door.\

`"…… Sheesh.@ I can't hide anything from Hisui."@
` I take my knife out of the drawer.@
` …… I don't intend to necessarily use it, but I just feel better with it by my side.@
br
`"---The park?@ Why would she call me out at this hour---"@
br
` Muttering, I think back to those foolish tales.@
` Vampires can only move about during night time.@
` So supposing that's true, then Yumizuka didn't call me out at this hour.@
` It's more like if it wasn't this hour, then she couldn't call me at all.\

`"…… No matter how much I think about it nothing will get done."@
` Right now I have to go to the park.@
` I exit the mansion quietly to avoid Hisui's notice.\

` *pant*--*pant*--*pant*
` I rest my body, burning from all the running.@
` It's almost midnight.\

` The park located off of the main road.@
` Because of the serial killings these past several days, there's not a soul to be seen around here.@
`"………"@
` Thump.@ My heart beats loudly.@
` My throat dries up from the tension.@
` If the phone call that Hisui received was from Yumizuka,
` then she has to be waiting there for me.\

` There isn't a sound under the moonlight.@

` Breathing raggedly.@

` Without a doubt, it is Yumizuka Satsuki.\

`"Wait… !"@
` Yumizuka stops me with just a word.\

`"…… Wait, Shiki-kun.@ I'm glad you came, but I don't want you any nearer right now.@ Please, don't come any closer."@

`"Then… the recent killings in town were all your doing, Yumizuka…!"@
`"I don't like to say it, but… that's the way it is, yeah."@
`"What the hell do you mean, 'That's the way it is' …!?"@
`"It's just the way it is.@ I killed those people, and I'll keep on doing the same thing.@ I can't just lie about it, can I?"\

`"Yumi… zuka, you--"@
`"Please.@ Stop calling me that.@ I'm calling you Shiki-kun, so it's only fair for you to call me by my first name too."@
`"Wha…"@
` I take a deep breath.@
` Yumizuka is still like before.@
` Even though she acts like she used to----she says some pretty scary things.\

`"When I think about it, I look foolish.@ I could never talk to you like this, for all the years I watched you from afar."@
`"Yumi… zuka?"@
`"I was always watching you, Shiki-kun.@ Even before I was saved in that warehouse, I was always watching you.@
` I'm… really a coward.@ I always just agreed with the people around me, and smiled when it seemed right.@ Before I knew it, everyone was treating me like an idol."\

`"So school wasn't fun for me.@ But that changed, after you talked to me in the second year of junior high, Shiki-kun."@
`"Eh--?"@
`"Nah.@ It's not something you'd remember.@ How can I put it… You were always natural, never showing off.@ Probably you didn't even think about what you said back then."\
`"------"@
` What can I say.@
` Just as Yumizuka says, I remember nothing.@
` I don't know what I said to her, or even if I had talked to her back then.\

` She recalls nostalgically.@
