` ………… *sigh*@
` What on Earth were you doing, Tohno-kun?@
` I never thought you would come to the rare third period lesson, the second "Shakes 'n Shivers Animal Land".@
br
` ----Well, Tohno-kun.@
` Unfortunately, I'll have to ask for a make-up.@
` It seems you have just drifted through every day without paying any particular attention to Arcueid, Ciel-san, or Akiha-san.\

` To tell you the truth, this is the most important part of Ciel-san's route.@
` But the fact that you still died means you have not received a charm from a certain person.@
` The moral of this story is you should pay more attention towards your Senpai at school!@
br
` First, go to the tea ceremony room after class.@
` Second, you should honestly recognize the mistakes you have made.@
br
` If you keep the above in mind, you should have no problems with the exam.@
` That's all for the third period lesson.@
` Please try hard so you won't end up here again next time.\
