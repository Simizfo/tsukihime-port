` Back then, the whole mansion was like a giant playground.@
br
` The garden, a deep forest.@
` The house, a tall castle.@
br
` We played in our own little world, which would take days to explore.\

` Every day was fun.@
` No one thought about ever growing up,
` and we believed that days and nights would always be the same.@
br
` It was just a childhood spent playing like puppies.@
` We got along wonderfully, and were the best of playmates.\

` Whenever I turned back, Akiha would be there, waving her hands and hiding shyly.@
` Yes, always the same.\

br
` …… I hear an unfamiliar voice.@
` The dream disappears, and all that remains is the feeling of my languid, waking body.@
br
`"It is morning.@ Time to wake up, Shiki-sama."@
br
` An unfamiliar voice greets me.@
` …… Stop calling me Shiki-sama already.@
` I told you yesterday, it sends chills down my back----\

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."@
` A girl in a maid uniform bows.@
`"Ah… yeah, I came home, right…"@
` I push myself up, and look around the room.\

`"Good morning, Hisui.@ Thanks for coming to wake me."@

`"There is no need to thank me.@ It is my duty to come and wake you, Shiki-sama."@
` Hisui answers indifferently, completely expressionless.@
`"Ah, really…?@ Okay then…"\

` …… Even in an unfavorable light, I think Hisui's features are beautiful.@
` It should be wonderful for such a girl to wake me every morning, but as Hisui never smiles, I don't feel that happy about it.@
` …… What a shame.@
` If Hisui only had half of Kohaku's brightness, she would be really cute.\

`"---Do you need something?"@
` Realizing I am looking at her, Hisui stares straight back at me.@
`"No, nothing at all.@ Waking up with you there makes me feel like I'm really at the Tohno mansion."@
` Now then.@ Getting off the bed, I stretch out both arms.\

`"Shiki-sama, there is no time.@ From the mansion to your school is a thirty minute trip.@ This leaves only twenty minutes for breakfast."@
`"Eh?@ …… Ahh!@ It's already seven o'clock!?"@
` I gasp in amazement after looking at the clock.@
` …… My repeated awakenings last night must have messed up my sleep pattern.\

`"Your uniform is folded and awaits you over there.@ Please come to the sitting room after you have changed."\

`"Damn it, if you're going to wake me, wake me up earlier…"@
` Muttering selfishly to myself, I reach for the uniform.@
` It's folded neatly, and the shirt has even been ironed.@
` Passing my wrists through the sleeves feels good.@ It's that fresh, brand-new feeling.\

` They are drinking tea together gracefully, as if breakfast ended a long time ago.\
