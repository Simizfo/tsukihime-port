` Classes end and the classroom empties, but I won't leave until the sun sets completely.@
br
` The red classroom.@
` The burning sunset spreads outside the window.@
` The sun flushes red as it sinks deep in the sky.@
`"------"@
` I'll always be waiting here.@
` I'll remember my unforgettable promise; I'll continue waiting here forever.\

br
` There's still one promise I haven't been able to fulfill.@
br
`"When this is all over----when we're done defeating this vampire… Before we part, can't we do something like this just once more?"@
br
` Back then, she tilted her head to the side in confusion.\

`"So----I really was wondering, what would happen if we were to meet again without any responsibilities… if we just met for no particular reason."@
br
` …… When I said those words,
` I was only thinking about her.\

`"----If you're too busy, then it's okay.@ I only thought of it just now, anyway."@
br
` …… Just…
` Not as two people cooperating,
` but as two friends who got along, not doing anything in particular.@
` If we could create some normal memories like that,\
br
` I knew she would be happy.\


br
br
br
br
` Okay----!@ When everything's over, let's come here again, Shiki!@
` It won't have any meaning, but I'm sure it will be really, really fun!@---
!w2000
br
` After her eyes widened in surprise, she nodded.@
` In the classroom bathed by the sunset,
` Arcueid smiled and made that promise with me.\

` ---I remember that promise.@
` ---I remember that smile.@
br
` ---I remember everything.@
br
` I can't forget.@
` I won't forget.@
` I'll always, always remember the promise we made in the room ablaze with the sunset to meet here again----\

`"……………"@
` The sun sinks further.@
` These hours until the vermillion fades completely,
` the quiet time until the crimson sky disappears.@
br
` This eternal, fleeting instant of a world standing still.@
br
` Maybe I am already crazy.@
` Even though I'm waiting for someone who will never come, my heart is horribly calm.\

!w5000

br
` ---Clatter.@
br
` The sound of something touching a desk.@
` I look.@
` A window is open.@
` I realize that,
` painted in red sunlight, she is standing by the window.\

` She doesn't move at all, but she's there.@
` She's right in front of me;
` she's not an illusion.@
` But, I feel like there is a distance which can never be spanned between us.@ "------"@
` I can't speak.@
` But, I feel so terribly calm now.\

`"…… Geez.@ I really was planning on disappearing, Shiki, but you'd just wait forever.@ I couldn't just leave you alone like that, so I came here."@
` She smiles bashfully.@
`"…… Well, you know.@ I did say I was never going to break a promise with you again."@
`"That's true.@ Thanks for keeping that promise."\

`"But, I'm sorry.@ It seems this time that I'm the one who won't be able to keep it."@
`"…… Why?"@
` …… I'm surprised myself.@
` I ask her this in a truly gentle voice, without any anger at all.\

`"…… Yeah, I never did tell you my reason for pursuing Roa.@
` Actually, a long time ago, I once drank human blood.@ At that time, the human stole some of my powers and became an incredibly strong Dead Apostle.@
` In the end, he ended up killing all the other True Ancestors except for me."@
br
` ---Then, that means…
br
`"…… You mean, Roa?"\

`"Yes.@ Until that time, I never knew about the vampiric impulse.@ The other True Ancestors also believed I did not have it.@
` But, it was too late.@ Until then----I didn't even know I was a vampire.@
` So----I didn't even know it was something I shouldn't do."@
` …… I see.@
` Never having been taught anything extra, she wasn't even taught she was the same as those she killed.\

`"Because of just one mistake, I destroyed everyone.@ …… So I won't drink human blood again.@
` But, a True Ancestor that has drank blood once cannot remain sane without doing it again."@
`"----"@
`"…… I can only be here because you completely "killed" Roa.@
` Even though I annihilated him so many times, it was only his flesh and not his soul.@
` But you killed his existence completely, Shiki.@ So----the power he stole returned to me and I somehow managed to revive."\

`"---That----doesn't……"@
br
`"But, that's all I can do.@ I can no longer resist the vampiric impulse inside of me.@ So----"@
br
`"---That---doesn't, matter."@
br
`"…… Shiki, I can't see you again.@ Sorry for breaking our promise."@
br
` …… That doesn't matter to me.@
` I just---want you to be by my side, that's all.\

`"…… You can keep your promise."@
`"Shiki……?"@
`"Drink my blood.@ If you do--you can keep your promise."\

!w3000

` Time passes by.@
` Neither of us says anything.@
` And after a truly maddening silence…\

`"----I see.@ But, I can't.@ I don't need your blood, Shiki."@
`"Why?@ Is my blood not good?@ Do you have a reason for not drinking it?"@
` She nods.@

`"I like you, so I won't."@
` She smiles like a flower blooming triumphantly.\

`"………………"@
` I suck in a large amount of air,
` and just try to suppress this feeling.@
br
` I want to stop her.@
` I want to stop her.@
` I want to stop her.@
` I want to stop her.@
br
` ----Even if I have to kill her, I want to stop her.@
br
` But, her smile is just too gorgeous.@
` I can't selfishly bring myself to ruin it.\

`"--Goodbye.@ I really am grateful for everything, Shiki."@
`"………………"@
` My throat trembles, and no sound comes out.@
br
` But still----I have to say goodbye.@
br
`"…… I'm, a liar."@
`"Why?@ You kept your promise, Shiki."@
`"----Just a worthless liar.@
` I…… said I would make you happy."@
` Yes, I vowed to.\

`"…… No, not at all.@
` I will sleep from now on, but I will always be dreaming of you.@ I enjoyed our time together so much, I will always be dreaming about it."@
`"------"@
`"It won't have any meaning, but I'm sure it will be really, really fun.@
` So Shiki, I really am happy.@ You really did make me happy."\

`"Damn…………"@
` My throat is filled up.@
` I don't----I don't want such a…\


`"…… You really are kind, Shiki.@ Yeah, I knew coming here to say goodbye was a good thing.@
` I love you, Shiki.@ Your honesty, how you are always spaced out, how I'm the only one you yell at, how you always look forward to the future… I love all of you.@
` So please, keep living like that, okay?"@
` For just an instant,
` she smiles sadly.@
br
` She waves her hand, and as if fading into the sunset itself, she disappears before my very eyes.\

`"………………"@
br
` I grit my teeth, trying to hold it in.@
` She was smiling until the very end, so at least I didn't want to cry.@
br
` ---The classroom is empty.@
br
`"……… I see.@ You, really did keep your promise."@
br
` In this classroom.@
` Our promise to meet again in the classroom as the sun set.@ She definitely kept it.\

` …… There are some things I lost, but it is now over.@
` The curtain has fallen cleanly over the time I knew her, the time I ran through with her.@
br
` Come to think of it, a farewell is always there.@
` In our case, our farewell was only early.@
` Thinking of it that way, this was a really satisfying farewell.@
` She was still alive, and she told… me… she's… still… happy…\

`"…… No……!@ Not like this, this isn't----what I wanted……!"@
br
` ---Right.@
br
` More---
` I wanted to be with her more.\
` I wanted to talk with her more.@
` I wanted to feel the warmth of her body more.@
` More----I wanted to see her smile more.\

` Always.@
` Not like this, but always----I wanted to make her happy.@
` But, she…
` Smiling to the end, she left me behind, telling me to live.\

bg "image\bg\ima_10.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

`"…… That stupid…… idiot……"@
br
` That was her final wish.@
` With a smile, she told me no matter how hard it is----even if I have to deceive myself right now, until I can finally see it all as simply a memory, to keep looking forward to the future and live.@
`"Tch…………!"@
` There's no way I can do that.@
` I---I don't have the slightest confidence to live like that.\

`"------"@
` Still, so that she can see a happy dream,
` I have to at least grant her wish.\

br
`"………… Ah."@
br
` I realize the sun has long since sank.@
` The crimson sky is painted over in a dark blue.@
br
` The dark night sky.@
` The spiral wisps of clouds and a bright, white moon.@
br
` ---They are all that's left.@
` But, an extremely beautiful memory.\

`"--------"@
br
` *sigh*@
` I exhale slowly, as if praying.@
` She may no longer be here,
` but I have to say what I forgot to say earlier.@
br
`"Goodbye.@ …… I had a lot of fun too."@
br
` Those extremely late words of farewell echo through the classroom.\

` Only the glass-like moon hangs in the night sky.@
` The distant blue moon looking as if it would shatter if touched.@
br
` For a long time---until dawn, I keep looking up at it.\
