`"It seems you already know about how there are the True Ancestors and the Dead Apostles.@
` So it is very simple.@
` The 'enemy' she is after is a Dead Apostle, nicknamed 'The Serpent'.@ Among the Dead Apostles, he is considered a heretic, a special vampire."\

`"…… This vampire is not as strong as 'Chaos', whom you defeated.@
` But, he is more difficult an opponent to eliminate than this 'Chaos' in a way.@ Since he comes back to life even after he dies."@
`"…… Um, Senpai.@ Vampires are immortal, so isn't it natural for them to come back to life after dying?"\

`"You eliminated 'Chaos', right?@
` Even if they are vampires, if you destroy their body and soul, they will be vanquished.@ If you kill a vampire, they will die.@ But 'The Serpent' is a vampire who has conquered even this."\


`"Tohno-kun, are you familiar with the cycle of reincarnation?@ It is part of Buddhist doctrine, so I would think a Japanese would be quite familiar with it."@
`"…… Yeah.@ It's that thing where when someone dies, they are reborn again as another human."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t04.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, exactly."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t12.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"In other words,
` The vampire named 'The Serpent' has made this cycle of reincarnation his own.@
` That's what I mean when I say he comes back to life even after he is killed."\
`"Reincarnation---you mean if he dies he will start over again as a baby……?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ While 'The Serpent' is alive, he chooses his next host and when it is born, he transmits all of the information of his 'self'.@
` 'The Serpent's' information stays deep within the baby until it matures, or until it gains sufficient intelligence.@
` As soon as that baby has the intelligence to succeed 'his self', the baby becomes a new vampire that is the 'Serpent'."@

`"---Wait a minute.@ What's that?@ Don't tell me that he does surgery on it while it's in the mother or something like that."\

`"No, it's not anything medical.@
` Because the instant his body is destroyed, he reincarnates into the body he chose as his next host.\
`"I said all of his information earlier, but to say it simpler, think of it as his 'soul'.@
` It wouldn't be quite correct to say his soul propagates through the air and takes over someone's body, but it's similar to an electro-magnetic wave.@
` In this case, the human brain is what does the transmitting and the receiving.@
` His exceptional point is that he took this soul, which is incalculable and something that disperses as soon as it leaves the envelope of the body, and processed it as something that could be transmitted."\

`"………………"@
` Her words don't seem quite real.@
` I do understand what she is saying.@
` This serpent guy is reborn as a baby when he dies and this baby turns into this Serpent vampire when it becomes an adult, but……\

`"…… If I believe your story, it means that he will never die.@ It's not immortality, but it's worse than that.@
` Being killed and reborn as someone else, that's like living forever."@
`"Yes, exactly.@
` It was eight hundred years ago when 'The Serpent' first became a Dead Apostle.@
` Since then, 'The Serpent' has been reborn seventeen times.@ Every time, Arcueid Brunestud has killed him."\

`"Arcueid did……?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes.@ To her, 'The Serpent' is a special vampire.@ …… Well, 'The Serpent' has a special meaning to me as well."@
`"…… But, even if he dies he will just be reborn, right?@ So---killing him over and over is pointless, isn't it?"\

`"----Yes.@
` He is killed by her, reincarnates, and is killed by her again.@
` That cycle has repeated itself over and over.@
` …… If Arcueid had the power to kill not the 'body' but the 'meaning', then this probably would not be happening."@
` Senpai looks down a little and she seems to be gritting her teeth.@
br
` …… I don't know why.@
` However, it seems that Senpai also has some grudge against the "enemy" like Arcueid does.\

`"…… A vampire that is reborn every time it is killed……"@
` That's Arcueid's and Senpai's "enemy".@
`"…… Senpai.@ This Serpent guy, what kind of a guy is he?"\


`"He was originally a man, but that can change depending on the body he reincarnates into.@
` The troublesome part of this Dead Apostle is that they are all hard to find.\
` Because he is properly born as a human baby, and has parents.\

` "The Serpent transforms into a vampire only when he reaches the age where he can do everything at a satisfactory level.\
` Until then, that human shows no hint of being a vampire.@ But once 'The Serpent' awakens, he uses the relationships he gained until that time to blend perfectly into society.@
` I heard that The Church detects the 'Serpent's' presence usually after a whole town is turned into The Dead."\

` …… I see.@
` For example, if this serpent guy were reincarnated in me, he would live as Tohno Shiki even after he becomes the serpent.@
` Unless he makes a big mistake, he would be free to suck blood without people realizing it.@
br
` ----That is.\

`"…… Scary.@ Of course those around him are in danger too.@
` But that human whom he reincarnated into, he would just disappear after maturing, right?@
` One moment that person is living normally and the next moment he suddenly turns into 'The Serpent'.@ That's very frightening."\

`"…… Yes, but it isn't like two people sharing one body.@ The human baby is still 'The Serpent'.@
` Depending on its environment, it's either a good or a bad person.@
` …… But even that disappears the instant 'The Serpent' awakens.@
` To sum it up, once 'The Serpent' dies, he is reborn into the next body, and once that body gains intelligence, it gains the previous life's self and becomes a vampire."\

`"…… That's, strange.@
` Even if he did reincarnate, that baby is still human.@ So, even if it does gain the self of a previous life, the body shouldn't turn into a vampire, right?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\cel_t07a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Reincarnation isn't the transmitting of personality, it is the transmission of a soul.@
` So the personality differs every time depending on their families and upbringings.@ But the soul itself does not change.@
` Once bitten by a True Ancestor, not only is the body forever soiled, but the soul as well.@ What changes the body is the soul.@
` 'The Serpent' transmits all his information called his soul, so when 'The Serpent' awakens, the body becomes one of a vampire but----"\

`"Yeah, but…"\
`"As you said, just that is too weak.@
` So he selects his next host while he is alive.@
` The family he is born into must meet two conditions, the first being one of wealth.@

` ---Please don't say stupid things.@
` Tohno-kun, you're just a normal boy.@
` So you shouldn't do such dangerous things.\
`"…………………"@
` Senpai was just worrying about me.@
` In the end, is it just that I chose Arcueid over Senpai?@
`"…… Why don't you understand your own feelings, Shiki?"@
` I ask my reflection in the window glass.\

` I go outside.@
` There were never many people around the mansion to begin with, but because of all these serial killings, it is unnaturally quiet.@ It's not even ten o'clock yet, but the emptiness makes it feel more like past one o'clock.\

` ----*sigh*@
` It is well into October and the wind is starting to blow colder.@
` Fall is nearly over as well.@ I walk down the empty street holding these sentimental thoughts.\

` I make my way around the mansion wall.@

` ---And then,
` I see a black figure leaning on the mansion wall.@
` A woman clothed in black stands not to block my way, but just to watch me go by.\

`"Sen, pai----"@

` I can't look at her face either.@
br
` I feel uneasy about what happened this morning, so I can't bring myself to directly look at her.\

`"Even after I said all that, you're still going to see her, Tohno-kun?"@
`"…… It can't be helped.@ I can't leave her alone, and I can't ignore the vampire in this city either."@
`"---I see, you've got a point there."@

`"Sorry, Senpai…… about a lot of things…"@

` …… I hear her voice behind me.@
` It doesn't seem like she intends to stop me from seeing Arcueid at all.@

` I guess Senpai has completely given up on me.\

`"Well then, I'll be going."@
`"Yes, please do as you like, Tohno-kun."@
` I can still only hear her voice.@
` Yet, I walk away from the mansion without even turning around.\

` Tap, tap, tap, tap.@
` The footsteps echo in the night along the residential street.@
` They aren't the footsteps of a heavy man, but of a much lighter body.@
` In addition, I'm wearing sneakers so they don't make such sounds.@
` Only shoes with a hard bottom can make this sound.@ For example, shoes like high-laced boots.@

` …… Actually, I don't even need to give an example.@
` Without a doubt, those footsteps belong to high-laced boots.\

` The footsteps cease at the same time.@

`"…… Um, is your house this way?"@
`"No, it's in the completely opposite direction.@ You went there once, Tohno-kun, did you forget already?"@
`"No, I remember.@ I just didn't have that much confidence in my memory."@
`"You should, because my house is that way."\

` "Oh, that's right," I say with a smile.@ "Yes, it is," she says, returning my smile.\
