` ----That was the final stop.@
br
` Just like my dream from last night, a dead body of someone I don't know is there in the back alley.\

` It's a woman.@ Her face is scraped from her chin to her nose, and I can't tell now if she is beautiful or not.@
` The flowing blood is incredibly sticky, and it reminds me more of red jelly than liquid.@
` From her body, her internal organs bloom out like the legs of an octopus.@ The pink mass of dead organs shines and looks warm.@
br
` In front of that corpse,
` a black, truly black figure is crouched and seems to be crying.\

`""-------Who are you!?""@
` Our voices overlap each other.@
` I ask him who he is, and he asks me who I am and turns.@
`""I am----""@
`"A killer." …… But which one of us said that?@

`"Eh---------?"@
` The dark figure tilts his head, puzzled.@
` The man crouching in front of the dead body looks at me, as if trying to compare the two of us.@
` During that moment,

`"--------Heh."@
` A laugh escapes my throat.@
` This man is a fake.@
` The puzzled figure in front of the corpse, and myself not feeling anything.@
` If you ask which one of us is more like a killer, the answer is simple.\

`"…… Is it you?"@
` The man says with trembling voice.@
` I stifle my laugh and naturally, as if I'm shaking his hand, stick my knife into his chest.@
br
` ---------Eh?@
br
` A voice shows his surprise.@
` Even though he's about to get killed, he is sluggish enough not to move.@ It makes me sick that this guy was calling himself a killer like that.\

` I vomit as I slice him.@
` Like a paper doll, he crumbles to pieces.\

br
` Drip drip, drip drip.@
br
` His blood drips from my hair.\

` I let out a deep breath.@

` Before my eyes is yet another dead body.@
` In my hands is my steaming knife.@
` The killer is dead, and the town is now safe like before.\

`"………… Let's go home."@
` Yes, I should go home.@
` Affected as I am, I should go back to the mansion.@
` Nothing has changed.@
` I'll live normally as Tohno Shiki, and continue the nightmare at night.\

br
` ---Really, nothing at all.@
br
` It's just a matter that instead of dream becoming a reality, it's just that I won't wake up from my dream anymore.@
