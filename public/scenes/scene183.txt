` ----It's morning.@
` I open my eyes and put on the glasses near my bed.@
` Looking out the window, I see a cloudless blue sky.@
br
`"………………"@
` Even though a flawless morning greets me, I can't help but feel down.@
` There's no need to wonder why.@
` What happened with Arcueid last night sticks in the back of my mind, and the accompanying guilt troubles me.\

`"…… She said we should just forget it----but I can't forget such a thing."@
` I look at both my hands.@
` Those fingers still remember how Arcueid felt.@
` Even now I remember the texture of her skin and her cool, gliding body temperature.@
` I wasn't thinking at all back then, but I understand it all now.\

` After doing such a thing.@
` Arcueid said to forget and pretend like it never happened.@ But while I regret it totally, I can't even forget one little bit of it.@
` What I regret is not being able to control myself back then.@
br
` If I didn't touch her like some animal, if I touched her more like a human, how would things have----\

br
` ----I knew it.@
br
` I didn't lose myself by looking into her golden eyes.@
` I didn't realize it, but I was caught up in her a long time ago.@
br
` To realize such a simple thing just now----\

` The morning in the Tohno mansion is the same as always.@
` Hisui comes to wake me.@ Akiha and Kohaku-san are in the sitting room, and we greet each other briefly before we go to school.@
br
` The same as always.@
` Yet I feel so empty, I can't even respond properly when people talk to me, and I leave the mansion vacantly.\

` The students streaming through the gate are all bright and cheerful.@
br
`"Oh yeah.@ Today is Saturday."@
` My sense of time has totally disappeared since Arcueid came into my life.@
` The first time I met her was on a Friday.@
` A week ago in the morning, she was waiting for me at the intersection in front of school.\

`"…… She was smiling, I think."@
` Come to think of it, she was smiling.@
` Even though she was waiting for the one who killed her, she was waiting for the killer Tohno Shiki with excitement in her eyes.@
br
`"…… I wonder why?@ If she comes tonight, maybe I'll ask her."@
` After thinking aloud, my spirits sink further.@
` She probably won't come to the park.@
` The feeling that last night was our final meeting turns over in my mind.\

` My heart is heavy and everything else simply feels empty.@
` I may not ever see her again.@ The regret hangs around me like a leaden chain----\

`"Yo, delinquent.@ You skipped class yesterday.@ What the heck were you doing, Tohno-kun?"@
`"…………"@
` I let out a heavy sigh.@
` Usually I would, but today I don't feel like talking with Arihiko at all.\

`"…… What's with you?@ You don't look happy at all.@ You didn't come to school yesterday and now you come back an empty shell.@ If you're like that, school's no fun."@
` Arihiko slumps his shoulders exaggeratedly.@
br
`"-----Arihiko.@ Sorry, but can you leave me alone today?@ If I'm not here, you can always talk with Senpai.@ Actually, isn't that better for you?"@
`"Huh----?@ Senpai?@ I don't know any third year students."\

`"…… What are you saying?@ Ciel-senpai's in third year, not second.@ …… Well, sometimes you think she's younger, but Senpai is a senpai after all."@
`"Shiel-Senpai?@ …… Who's that?@ Are there any foreign students at our school?"@
` He seriously tilts his head in thought.\

`"What are you saying, Senpai is Japanese……"@
br
` No, wait.@
` No one ever said she was Japanese.@
br
`"…… Well, no one said she was, but everyone called her Ciel-senpai."\

`"That's what I'm saying, who is this senpai?@ What's wrong Tohno, are you sick or something?"@
` I can't hear his banter.@

`"Wha………………"@
` That's right.@ Why didn't I realize such an obvious inconsistency?@
` Ciel isn't a Japanese name at all.@
` Even though I know her, I don't even know her full name.@ I don't even know what class she's in.@
br
` To begin with,
` when I first met her, why did I feel like I knew her for a long time……?\

` Turning away from Arihiko whose head is tilted in confusion, I dash out of the classroom.\

` To be sure, I ask the teachers in the office, but none of them remember Ciel-senpai.\

` The end of classes.@
` Being a Saturday, right after homeroom all my classmates scatter and run out of the room.@
