` The weather's great so I decide to go to the park.@
` We can relax there and then go somewhere else more appropriate later.\

bg "image\bg\bg_28a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

` We enter the park.@
` It's still midmorning but there's a bunch of people my age here.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_mid
`"Hm, there's a lot of people here during the day.@ I've met you here a lot, but it seems like a totally different place."@
` Arcueid seems to be in a good mood.@
` I just planned to walk around the park, but she doesn't seem discontent at all.\

`"Oh, there's a store in a place like this.@ Shiki, what does that sell?"@
` Arcueid points excitedly at a vendor's stand.@
` The path from the fountain leads to a wheeled ice cream stand.\

`"That's an ice cream seller out of season.@ Cold things aren't good for the body, so we should just pass it up for now." I stop Arcueid's question before she asks.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t11.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
` No matter how unhappy a face she makes, I don't think eating ice cream in the fall would be good at all.\

` ----But, what is this strange feeling?@
` I feel weird just walking, I feel everyone's watching us……\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey Shiki, do you know all these people?"@
`"No, there's only one person I know who'd skip school to hang around like that.@ Why?"@
`"Hm, a lot of people seem to be looking at us, so I thought maybe you knew them."@
`"…… I see.@ So that's what felt strange."\

` I get it now.@
` I was just walking around to find a good spot on the grass to sit down on, but everyone is stealing glances at us.@
` It doesn't need to be said, but they're looking at Arcueid, not me.\

` I've been doing my best not to be conscious of it, but Arcueid is just unbelievably beautiful.@ And walking in the park is just asking for stares.@
br
` The guys killing time in the park all start to look at her.@
` …… For some reason, I feel angry.\

`"Arcueid, let's go somewhere else."@
` Grabbing her hand, I pull her as I walk towards the back of the park.@

bg "image\bg\bg_29a.jpg",%type_lcartain_mid

` The place we usually meet has much less people than right in front of the fountain.@
` …… This should be little better than before, at least.\

`"We'll kill time here a little bit.@ I'm going to get something to drink, you have any requests?"@
` I let go of her hand and turn towards her.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"U…… um, is water okay?"@
`"Sure.@ Go ahead and sit on that bench…… if some guy starts to talk to you, just don't listen to him."@
` Saying that, I run to a nearby vending machine.\

` Even though it's now past noon, we don't leave the park.@
` …… I'm not sure why, but Arcueid's been quiet since we came here.@
` She hasn't even drank the water I got for her, and she just looks around the park doing nothing.\

` We watch the flocks of pigeons around the park and the happily running figures of children accompanied by their mothers.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey, Shiki."@
`"Hm?@ Are you bored just spacing out?@ We can go somewhere and get something to eat if you want."@
`"No, that isn't it…… I was just wondering about what happened before."@
`"……?"@
` Before?@ …… What is she talking about?\

`"I don't get it.@ What do you mean?"@
`"I'm talking about when you grabbed my hand earlier.@ We've come into contact before, but there was always a reason.@ But just now, there wasn't a reason, so I was wondering just what it was."@
`"What it was?----There really wasn't a reason or anything."\

` Saying that, I also get confused.@
` …… Come to think of it, I pulled her along naturally for no reason.@
` That being said, I don't even understand why.\

`"It doesn't really matter.@ It's not that big of a deal.@ Something sudden like that, is just human."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"I see.@ Having lots of things done for no reason… you've done a lot of useless things."@
` Arcueid replies, amazed.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Hey Shiki.@ It's kind of off topic, but did you ever have a time like that?"@
` She really is asking about random things.@
` She's looking at the playing children, so she's probably asking about that.\

`"…… Hmm, Maybe.@ I played around a lot as a kid, but that was only inside the mansion.@ I rarely ever played in a park like this."@
br
` …… That's right.@ My only playmates were Akiha and the others.@ I never played with people I didn't know like these kids.@
br
` I might have been more like…
` A kid who led an insulated life.\

`"What about you, Arcueid?@ …… Um, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to."@
` …… Um, if vampires didn't have a childhood, asking her would be rude.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yeah.@ Like you're thinking, I never had a childhood.@ While I was weak as an individual, I slept through it, and I was active only when my existence was at its peak.@
` That's why I thought it was strange.@ Infancy and old age are such useless times, why do people manage to live through it?"@
` She seems to be almost asking herself, not me.\

`"…… Arcueid?"@
`"It's nothing.@ This is the first time I ever spent time doing nothing, so my thoughts seem to be malfunctioning."@
cl c,%type_crossfade_fst
` Saying that, Arcueid stands up from the bench.@
` I stand up with her.@
` …… Well, we've already been in the sun for about two hours, so we should probably head into the city.\

`"----Oh, if it was dull you should've told me so."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Hm, maybe it is dull, but it wasn't boring.@
` I was even thinking I'd like to spend more time if it's this kind of dull, but you didn't like it?"@
`"Eh……?"\

` …… That's right, even if it was uneventful, it wasn't boring.@
` Come to think of it, spending time sunbathing with Arcueid is something pretty rare.\

`"----That's right, it wasn't bad at all.@ But, let's get something to eat.@ I haven't had anything since this morning, so I'm pretty hungry."@
` Saying that, we start to walk from the park.\

`"Hm------"@
` For a brief moment, I think about holding her hand but I stop right away.@
` There wasn't any reason for it before, so it felt natural to do so.@
` But now that I have a reason to do so, to hold her hand seems very senseless.\

` …… To be senseless means that taking notice is the result of less-than-pure thoughts.@
br
`"I'm full of theories today."@
br
` Geez.@ Just like Arcueid says, I guess I do a lot of useless things.\
