` I start walking from the mansion atop the hill towards school.@
` Like any other day, the morning is wrapped in tranquility.@
br
` Autumn is almost over and winter is close by.@
` Perhaps when this vague season in between the heat of summer and the chill of winter changes,
` maybe this transparent feeling will also change.\

` I see more figures of students in uniforms the closer I get to school.@
` Today is Saturday so most of them are smiling as they walk along the road.@
` Once I pass this intersection, I'll reach the front gate.@
` It will soon be a month since I came back to the Tohno mansion.@
` I've already become well used to this route by now.@
br
` The traffic light turns red and I stand in front of the crosswalk.@
br
`"…………"@
` Every time I stop here, I remember.\

` That one time.@
` At this intersection, Arcueid was waiting for Tohno Shiki back then as she sat on the guardrail, just like she is doing now.@
br
`"-----Eh?"@
br
` I say without even thinking.@
` Between the cars rushing by, a scene unfolds just like before.\

`"-----Wha……"@
` She's there.\

` Dressed in white, with golden hair down to her shoulders.@
` Long, slender eyebrows over crimson eyes.@
` ---Her figure I could never mistake for anyone else no matter what.@ This figure that has already vanished long ago.\

`"--------"@
` The light turns green.@
` The students around me start moving.@
` In the midst of it.@
` I am the only one who stands still and she is the only one who notices I am here.\

` She has her typical smile as she crosses the intersection.@
`"------"@
` I can't speak.@
` I'm so overwhelmed with emotion I don't even know what to do.@
br
` ---Even if, this is just some sort of bad illusion,
` I'm so happy just to see her again I could cry.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_lshutter_mid
`"Hello.@ Are you heading to school, Student-san?"@
` …… I can't believe it.@
` The illusion even has her voice down perfectly.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01b.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki?@ Hey, why are you so quiet?@ Don't tell me you forgot about me?"@
` Those red eyes looking up at me…
` …… There's no way I could forget.@
` But, at the same time, there's no way she can be here, alive.\

`"------"@
` I can't speak.@
` She wrinkles her eyebrows together and glares at me like an angry cat.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t16.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Geez, what gives.@ I put up with not going to see you and was waiting here so long.@ …… Don't tell me, you're angry, Shiki?"@
`"U------"@
` …… I just can't believe it.@
` This isn't an illusion in front of me.@ It really is-----\

`"…… Ar…… cueid……?"@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes it's me.@ ------Thank goodness.@ I thought you became a vegetable after fighting Roa.@ I really was worried you know."@
`"----"@
br
` --Wait a minute.@
br
` Um----I'm so confused, what do I say?@ What should I be happy about?@ Is there something I need to do?@
` I----really am just so overwhelmed I don't know.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t11.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Shiki……?@ Hey, you're acting funny.@ Your mouth is wide open, and so are your eyes.@
` …… Well, it's kind of interesting for me so I'll keep watching."@
`"----Ar, cueid."@
`"That's what I mean.@ …… Geez, you keep just saying my name.@ We finally managed to meet again, so can't you find anything more fitting to say?"\
br
` ----Yeah, there's no mistake.@
` There's only one person who could say such ridiculous things.\

`"…… Why?"@
`"Hm?@ I can't hear you, please say it a little louder."@
` She tells me c'mon, c'mon as she points her ear closer to me.@
`"----Why are you still alive!?"@
` I scream and voice my feelings as loud as I can.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t12.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst
`"Ow----Not so loud, Shiki."@
`"You…… don't say 'not so loud'!@ Why are you alive……!\
`"I----thought you were gone, that I would never see you, that I would always------"@
` regret it.@ But why?@
` This cheerfully, as if we only said goodbye yesterday, how can she greet me so simply……!?\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t03.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Oh, I see.@ I never did tell you, Shiki."@
` Arcueid drops a fist to her other hand in realization.@
`"…… Yeah, I never did tell you my reason for pursuing Roa.@ He stole some of my power.@
` In order to take it back,I pursued him but you completely destroyed him, right?@ And the power that was freed from Roa returned to me and I managed to come back to life."@
`"Y----you never told me about that!"@
`"No, I didn't.@ It didn't really concern you."@
`"Y----"@
` You, why did----\


`"Anyway, I revived, but I could barely resist the vampiric impulse inside of me.@
` I probably would have done something terrible if I went to see you, so I slept until I regained my power.@
` Because of that I was able to return to normal, but it took seven days to suppress my impulse."\
`"Eh----then, then you're really okay now, Arcueid……?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst


`"Of course!@ If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here."@
` She flashes me a full smile.@
` Arcueid takes my hand.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"You know, Shiki.@ While I was asleep, I was really looking forward to meeting again like this.@
` Because once I did, we could go around and do so many things.@
` I was thinking it would be so nice to get better even just a little quicker."@
` Arcueid looks at me with a pure, unadulterated smile.\

`"------"@
` I'm speechless.@
` Not in a bad way----I'm just… so happy.@
` Being able to see her smile again, all the things we can do from now on,
` how I told Senpai that my wish was never to leave Arcueid alone again…
` Not one----not one of them was lost.\

`"------"@
` There's so many things I want to say and tell her right now.@
` But, right now I'll just speak honestly from the heart.@
br
`"----Welcome back.@ I've… been waiting for a long time."@
` I squeeze her hand in return, and briefly tell her just that.@
` She looks a little bewildered at first.@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t14.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"…… Yeah."@
` Saying that, she looks away in embarrassment.\

`"…… Arcueid?"@
` I call out to her.@
` After a brief pause, she faces me with a full smile.@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t09.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Yes, I'm back.@ I'm glad you were still yourself, Shiki."@
`"------"@
` My chest tightens.@
` If this wasn't right on the way to school, I would embrace and kiss her.@ Her smile is just so adorable.\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Alright, let's go Shiki.@ You're going to take me to many places, right?"@

cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` Arcueid releases my hand and jumps like a rabbit.@
` …… She's so radiant I can barely look at her directly.\

`"But, um----where?"@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t08.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Anywhere.@ Somewhere you think is fun, Shiki."@
` Smiling, Arcueid replies like it's nothing.@
` But, that's a little troubling.@
`"…… Um, you know, I do have school."@
ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t06.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Hey.@ Can't you at least spend a day with me today?"@
` Arcueid looks dissatisfied.\

`"…… Uh."@
` …… Evidently, I'm extremely weak against that face of hers.@
` …… Well, even if I went to school like this, I wouldn't be able to concentrate there, and more than anything else----I want to be with Arcueid.\

`"…… Hm, you're right.@ Who cares about boring reputation.@
` Okay, Arcueid.@ I will indulge your selfishness for the day, my princess."@
`"Yay!"@
cl c,%type_lshutter_mid

` Bump.@
` She suddenly presses her body up against mine.\

bg "image\event\ark_f03.jpg",%type_lshutter_fst

`"Hey, Shiki.@ That night, what you were talking about with Ciel, your feelings haven't changed?"@
` She looks up imploringly at me as she asks.@
`"…… My feelings that night----what do you mean?"@
`"About you saying you loved me."@
`"------!"@
` I start to splutter.@
` It's too embarrassing for her to ask me this question when she's this close to me.\

`"…… Oh, I forgot.@ You shouldn't eavesdrop, Arcueid."@
`"I can't help it if I overheard.@ Anyway, c'mon, answer me.@ Your words that night, they haven't changed?"@
br
` ----Idiot.@
` I don't even need to say that.@
br
`"…… Yeah, they haven't changed.@ I can't make any guarantees, but they'll probably never change."@
` I'm so embarrassed I look up at the sky and answer.\

` Arcueid wraps her arms around mine.@
`"Oh.@ Then you should prepare yourself, Shiki."@
`"Prepare?@ Prepare for what?"@
` I can't help but let a tinge of uneasiness creep in my voice.@
` She holds onto my arms and speaks with a smile.\

br
br
br
br
br
`"Because you promised to be with me forever.@
` Didn't I say so when we first met?@
` I'll have you take responsibility for me."@

\

` Then she starts to walk, still holding onto my arm.\
` She's as energetic as a little child urging me to hurry up to get to a playground.@
br
`"Oh---I see.@ Certainly I would have to prepare."@
` Speaking to no one in particular, I start to walk with her.\

` I head towards some random place, going against the flow of students going to school.@
` Where to?@
` Well, there's no place we can't go.@
` The sunlight really suits this princess of the moon accompanying me.\

` ---The weather is a perfect blue sky.@
br
` Hand in hand, we walk towards a new beginning for the two of us.\
